# rk3588-aimbot

AI visual aimbot (mouse pass-through) running on an **RK3588** board. The board's own HDMI receiver
takes the game picture, an AX650N card (AXCL runtime) runs the detector, and a delay-aware control law
computes mouse corrections. Commands are merged with the real mouse and emitted through a userspace USB
device stack built on the kernel's `raw_gadget` (the device identifies as a generic USB mouse), so it
behaves like an ordinary mouse.

Three output modes (`-M`, mutually exclusive): **hid** — the mouse path above; **pad** — a physical
Xbox-layout gamepad is passed through 1:1 and the law's desired velocity is merged onto its right stick,
while the board presents itself to the host as a **wired Xbox 360 pad** (`0x045E/0x028E`), so the host's
own XInput stack reads it as a controller; **p5g** — the same input/merge/calibration chain aimed at the
PS5: the board enumerates as the **P5 General dongle's own shape** (`0x2B81/0x0101`, a 165-byte HID
report descriptor, 64-byte input reports) while a **real P5 General dongle** plugged into one of its host
ports signs every report over hidraw, so the PS5 only ever receives bytes the dongle returned, and the
PS5's auth challenge/response (feature reports `0xF0`/`0xF1`/`0xF2`) is forwarded verbatim — with no
dongle present, no report is produced at all. The gamepad channel keeps full 16-bit stick resolution end
to end: an 8-bit device (`0..255`, rest `128`) is expanded by a compile-time 256-entry table — the
midpoint code 128 maps to exactly 0 and the 255 physical levels are spread over ±32767 with a uniform
step of 258 (`= floor(32767/127)`, chosen over 257 so the top level is not left 0.4 % short of full
deflection); the single short step and the overflow both land at the deepest level (`out[0] = −32767`,
`out[255] = +32766`). Already-centred devices pass through unchanged, and each wire format inverts that
channel exactly: the XInput encoder writes the int16 logical value, the P5G encoder writes the 8-bit code
back (`floor(v/258) + 128` — the identity on all 256 codes, with the injection's own 16-bit amount landing
as whole 8-bit steps of 258 logical counts).

## Pipeline

```
Board HDMI RX (rk_hdmirx; the live signal is 2560×1440@120 BGR3)
→ bare V4L2 MULTIPLANAR capture on dmabuf (zero copy, dma-fence gated, newest-frame delivery)
→ RGA centre 1:1 crop to the canonical window (no scaling)
→ AXCL NPU (AX650N, .axmodel) → decode → NMS
→ alpha-beta tracking → control law (pole-placement PI + type-2 velocity feedforward)
→ merged with the real mouse (hid) / with the physical gamepad's right stick (pad, p5g)
→ USB raw_gadget userspace device: generic HID mouse, wired Xbox 360 pad, or P5 General pad
  (p5g additionally signs every report through the real dongle on a host port)
→ control tick 1 kHz → game
```

Three properties of the capture side are worth knowing before touching it: the **format is the signal's**
(the receiver's driver refuses `S_FMT` for anything but the format it currently carries, so the layer
reads `G_FMT` and adapts, taking stride and `sizeimage` from the driver); **the payload is not complete
when `DQBUF` returns** in low-latency mode, so a **dma-fence** gates every frame (measuring displacement
on a half-written picture would read real motion); and a **lost TMDS lock is a stream the driver stopped
by itself** — re-locking does not reattach it, so the layer detects the loss, rebuilds the session and
recovers, without ever taking the process down. The law's frame-length scale is the receiver's own locked
timing, so **there is no frame-rate parameter**.

## No hand-tuned gains, one hand-set speed scale

Aim at a static background with texture, take both hands off the controls and hold both side keys for 5
seconds (the gamepad modes: L3+R3, or the panel's 「开始标定」 button). The program excites the loop — per
axis, alternating deflections that stop the moment the picture has travelled far enough, each followed by
a quiet pause — measures the background motion with block phase correlation, and estimates the **physical
loop delay `L` (ms)**, the one calibrated quantity, from three independent readings of that same observation
stream (a sub-frame-exact tail sum plus two frame-quantized edges). The round skips the inference chain, so
the leg it genuinely bypasses (pack + H2D + exec + D2H + decode, the segment the `[AI FPS]` line reports) is
accumulated from ordinary frames and **added** on the way out, while the legs the round pays itself — waiting
for a frame's payload and the RGA crop — are not added again; the written value is therefore the whole loop
delay, and the round's log states all three numbers. Success is a nod and writes back that output mode's
delay VAR (`HID_L_EST` for hid, `PAD_L_EST` for pad, `P5G_L_EST` for p5g) into the per-game launch script; a
failure is a shake that writes nothing and states its reason and evidence in the log. The
control-law bandwidth is then derived from `L` via phase margin (`wn=(90°−PM)π/180/L`, PM=50°) and the
per-game speed feel is dialled by four per-axis **pull-speed ratios** (`--spd`, `--ads-spd`: effective
sensitivity = baseline / (ratio/100), so `100` is the baseline and a larger ratio means a faster pull) —
inside the law nothing is hand-tuned; the speed scale is the one input the operator supplies: the game's
own input sensitivity, which the firmware cannot observe (its correct value puts the loop at its design
point, and the law's proven mismatch envelope is ±30%). Adapts to PC/PS5 and 60/120fps.

**A pixel is not an angle**, so the two operator-supplied quantities and the ratios are tied to the source
resolution. Going to a source with `R×` the pixels per degree (for the same field of view, the width
ratio): `MAX_SPEED` (px/s) and `FOV_RADIUS` (px) scale **up** by `R`, and the pull-speed ratios scale
**down** by `R` (more pixels per degree means the game's real sensitivity is higher, and a larger ratio
means "assume a lower sensitivity" — so a ratio left at its old value makes the firmware emit too many
counts and the crosshair over-pull). The reference of those derivations is 1080p; **the deployment signal
is 2560×1440, i.e. `R = 4/3`, and the values this repository ships are the landed ones**: `MAX_SPEED`
2667 px/s, `FOV_RADIUS` 200 px, the pull-speed ratios 75 — in the launcher template, in the panel's
defaults and in the firmware's interactive defaults alike; `L` and the window side are unchanged.
`AGENTS.md`'s Tuning section carries the rule, its worked example and where each number is written down.

## Control law

The single binary `bin/aimbot` runs **ff_pi_acc**: pole-placement PI + type-2 velocity feedforward with
direction-contradiction CUSUM velocity reset and an innovation-mean acceleration channel, plus optional
training-data collection (`-o`, otherwise pure aimbot). The law was selected and tuned in `arena/`, a
neutral pure-Python plant+sensor simulator that also hosts the alternative laws (ballistic, sliding, MPC,
…) kept as Pareto points in speed/robustness. `AGENTS.md` is the full design document;
`arena/AUTHORING.md` is the law-author guide.

## Parameter face

Every per-game value lives in the launcher script (`scripts/game/<game>.sh`, a copy of
`template.sh.example`), and **the script is the single source of truth** — the panel only rewrites the
values of the VARs it knows and leaves every other line byte-identical. Each hand-edited value carries a
guard default (`CLASS_ID="${CLASS_ID:-0}"`), so a script missing any single line still launches; the panel
reads the guard's effective value, not its literal text.

| Script VAR | CLI | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `OUTPUT_MODE` | `-M` | `hid` / `pad` / `p5g` — mutually exclusive, each owns the UDC |
| `MOUSE_KEYWORD` | `-D` | hid: mouse `by-id` substring or `/dev/input/eventN` (empty = lexicographically first `*-event-mouse`) |
| `PAD_KEYWORD` | `-P` | pad/p5g: gamepad match substring (empty = any `*-event-joystick`; the dongle's own node is excluded) |
| `PAD_TRIG_THR` | `-T` | pad/p5g: trigger threshold in % of full scale, shared by RT and LT; it gates the aim-trigger decision only — the analog value passes through 1:1 (hot param `padthr`) |
| `PAD_DUMP` | `--pad-dump` | pad/p5g: log the merged logical state every ≥50 ms (injection debugging) |
| `HID_L_EST` / `PAD_L_EST` / `P5G_L_EST` | `-l` | the calibrated **complete** loop delay (the round's physical reading plus the averaged inference leg; the frame-wait and RGA legs the round pays itself are not added), **one slot per output mode** — the only quantity the firmware ever writes back (each is hand-editable too) |
| `HID_SPDX` `HID_SPDY` `HID_ADS_SPDX` `HID_ADS_SPDY` | `--spd` / `--ads-spd` | hid slot: pull-speed ratios, per axis (integer; `100` = baseline, larger = faster, meaningful band `5..2000`; shipped default `75` = the baseline at the 1440p deployment source) |
| `PAD_SPDX` `PAD_SPDY` `PAD_ADS_SPDX` `PAD_ADS_SPDY` | `--spd` / `--ads-spd` | pad slot: the same four in the gamepad channel's units |
| `P5G_SPDX` `P5G_SPDY` `P5G_ADS_SPDX` `P5G_ADS_SPDY` | `--spd` / `--ads-spd` | p5g slot: the same four for the PS5 channel |
| `CLASS_ID` / `CLASS_N` | `-c` / `-n` | target class (`-1` = do not filter by class — the firmware does not clamp `-c`, so the panel passes it through as-is); model class count (`0` = derive from the attribute count — needed only by an unfolded DFL head, whose `reg_max` is not observable) |
| `CONF_THRESH` / `Y_OFFSET` / `CAM_DEV` | `-t` / `-y` / `-d` | confidence, aim height offset, capture device (`/dev/videoN`; empty = resolve the receiver by driver name) |
| `MAX_SPEED` | `-x` | crosshair speed cap px/s (derivation in the template; a pixel quantity, shipped as 2667 = the 1080p reference's 2000 carried to the 1440p deployment source) |
| `AIM_KEY` / `AIM_ENABLED` / `FOV_R` / `PREVIEW` | `-k` / `-a` / `-r` / `-v` | trigger key, mouse takeover, FOV radius (also a pixel quantity: shipped as 200 px = the reference's 150 px at 1440p), preview |
| `CAPTURE` `CAP_FIRE` `CAP_DET` `CAP_AUTO` `OUT_DIR` `FIRE_MS` `AUTO_S` `COOLDOWN_MS` `JPEG_Q` | `-o` `-e` `-F` `-A` `-C` `-q` | training-data collection |

**Each output mode owns a slot of five values** (one delay + four ratios), and switching `OUTPUT_MODE`
switches the whole slot: the launcher's `case` takes that slot's delay and ratios, the firmware writes a
calibration back only into that slot's delay VAR, and the panel shows, edits and saves only the current
mode's slot. The slots are not interchangeable, which is why they exist: each mode's loop delay is its own
physical quantity (`p5g` adds the dongle's signing round trip to it).

The per-game feel is the four integer ratios of the active slot — there is no per-axis sensitivity entry,
no second gain and no curve coefficient. Each ratio is an inverse factor on the effective gain
(`base × 100 / ratio`), and both bases are compile-time constants (`S_HID_BASE` = 1.0 px/count,
`GAIN_PAD_BASE` = 3000 px/s full deflection). The base only decides how close a ratio's first guess is;
the ratios are what gets dialled, and the injection, the ledger→pixel scale and the own-motion compensation
all consume the same per-axis effective gain, so they cannot desynchronize.

## Hot-parameter channel

The binary opens a **localhost-only** UDP channel (`127.0.0.1:47700`, datagrams of
`key=value;key=value`) so a running instance can be retuned without a restart. Whitelisted keys — `t` `y`
`x` `fov` `padthr` `spdx` `spdy` `adsspdx` `adsspdy` `k` `aim` `cap_fire` `cap_det` `cap_auto` — are
clamped by the firmware as well, so the sender is never trusted; `padcalib=1` requests one calibration
round (consumed once; a request arriving mid-run is logged and dropped, never re-entrant). Structural
constants (PM/ζ/FF gain/CUSUM thresholds) are compile-time and deliberately absent from the wire. Every
applied key is echoed as a `[热参] …` log line; the full table with clamps is in `webui/README.md`.

## WebUI

```bash
cd <deploy-root>/webui
sudo python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo bash deploy/install.sh           # systemd unit + autostart; token printed in the journal
sudo journalctl -u aimbot-webui -n 20 --no-pager   # first-run token → set a password in the browser
```

It is an **orchestrator, not a replacement**: it runs the same two steps a launcher does
(`scripts/setup_platform.sh` → `bin/aimbot` with the full parameter set, `-S` pointing at the profile
script so calibration writes back to the same place). Adding a game means copying
`scripts/game/template.sh.example` → `<game>.sh` (the panel has a "copy profile" button too); the new
script shows up in the profile list on the next scan. The output mode is a field of the profile, and the
rows a mode owns (`-D` for hid, `-P`/`-T`/`--pad-dump` for pad/p5g) and the mode's five-value slot (delay
+ four ratios) are shown only for that mode — switching it changes which device VARs reach the generated
command line, and the delay plus all four ratios switch with it (`HID_L_EST`/`HID_SPDX`… ↔
`PAD_L_EST`/`PAD_SPDX`… ↔ `P5G_L_EST`/`P5G_SPDX`…); a save writes back only the current mode's slot.
Calibration runs from the launcher's key hold (both side keys for hid, L3+R3 for the gamepad modes) or,
for pad/p5g, from the panel's 「开始标定」 button (hot param `padcalib=1`). The model list is
`engine/**/*.axmodel` — **conversion happens outside this repository**, so a model has to be produced
elsewhere and dropped into `engine/` before it can be selected. The `[标定]` lines, the per-segment
readings and the verdict stay visible in the page's log stream; the 60 s report-rate lines
(`[USB-HID]`/`[PAD-USB]`), `[AI FPS]` and `[SAVE]` are filtered out of it (they appear as cards and
history instead, and the raw ring is still in the download). `webui/README.md` is the operator manual
(permissions, security, discovery model, hot-param table, acceptance checklist).

## Build & run (on the board, over ssh)

```bash
sudo bash scripts/setup_platform.sh   # idempotent: librga / raw_gadget + UDC / axcl — run it first
bash scripts/compile.sh              # → bin/aimbot, the five unit tests (also run) and three probes
cp scripts/game/template.sh.example scripts/game/<game>.sh   # one launcher per game
chmod +x scripts/game/<game>.sh
scripts/game/<game>.sh               # calibrate once; the mode's delay VAR is written back into it
```

`setup_platform.sh` is the single platform-setup entry point and the launcher and the panel both call it
before every start: it installs and verifies **librga** (pinned to the upstream version the 6.1 kernel's
`rga3` driver accepts), loads **raw_gadget** (persisting it in `/etc/modules-load.d`, setting
`/dev/raw-gadget`'s permissions and vacating the UDC) and verifies the **axcl** runtime
(`/usr/lib/axcl`, `/dev/axcl_host`), which belongs to the board's BSP image. Device-tree or kernel-config
changes are not part of it — those are image facts.

`compile.sh` builds and **runs** `build/control_test`, `build/pad_test`, `build/calib_test`,
`build/detect_test` and `build/hdmi_test`; a failing assertion aborts the whole build. It also builds
three probes that are not run by it (they need root, the card and a live signal): `hdmi_probe` (capture
layer: frame rate, delivery latency split into fence wait and userspace overhead, the crop compared
byte-for-byte against a CPU reference, and the lock-loss → re-lock walk), `model_probe` (one `.axmodel`'s
IO contract, a real image end to end, each output's codeword length, the per-segment percentiles) and
`pipeline_probe` (the production `CapturePipeline` against the live signal).

The launcher's `OUTPUT_MODE` picks the channel (`hid` mouse / `pad` Xbox 360 pad / `p5g` P5 General pad,
the two gamepad modes sharing `PAD_KEYWORD`, `PAD_TRIG_THR` and `PAD_DUMP`). Before a `p5g` run,
`sudo python3 scripts/test/p5g_dongle_probe.py` dumps the real dongle's descriptors, exercises the three
feature transfers and times the signing round trip (that round trip is the hardware bound on a
continuously-updated report stream). The gamepad end-to-end check on the board is
`sudo python3 scripts/test/uinput_pad_test.py --mode pad|p5g` (synthesizes a virtual pad and asserts the
whole input/merge chain through `--pad-dump`; the dump reads the publish point, which is
backend-independent, so the same assertions cover the P5G backend); the calibration round has its own
driver, `sudo python3 scripts/test/uinput_calib_test.py --mode hid|pad|p5g` (synthesizes the mode's trigger
device, drives one round against the live signal and asserts the trigger, the excitation waveform, the
measured sampling rate and the write-back rule); the host-side verdict for the XInput backend is
`powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/test/xinput_probe.ps1` (`XInputGetState` rc / packet
number / decoded fields).

**未验证 on this board**: the USB output side has not yet been exercised against a real host — the
backends' device bytes, encoders and the P5G auth/signing state machine are pinned by the unit tests,
while "a real PC reads the emulated pad through XInput" and "a real PS5 accepts the presented device" are
still open (the dongle-side facts are recorded in `docs/p5general/` §14). Likewise, a source
resolution/refresh change across a capture rebuild is code-read only; the walk-through exercised end to
end is a lock loss → re-lock at an unchanged mode.

## arena (control-law development)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt   # Windows dev machine
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m arena.selftest                    # validate the simulator
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m arena.eval ff_pi_acc              # standard test suite for the main law
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m arena.integrate                   # all-law leaderboard + robustness sweeps
```

`arena/` is pure Python and platform-independent — it needs nothing the board provides.
