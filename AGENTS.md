## Overview

AI visual aimbot (mouse pass-through) for **RK3588** (aarch64 — the deployment board is an
OrangePi 5 Plus class machine, vendor kernel 6.1, g++/C++17, OpenCV 4, the kernel's `raw_gadget`).

```
Board HDMI RX (rk_hdmirx; the live system carries 2560×1440@120 BGR3)
→ bare V4L2 MULTIPLANAR capture on dmabuf (zero copy, dma-fence gated, newest-frame delivery)
→ RGA centre 1:1 crop to the canonical window (no scaling)
→ AXCL NPU inference (AX650N card, .axmodel) → decode (core/detect) → NMS
→ alpha-beta tracking → control law (pole-placement PI + type-2 velocity feedforward)
→ merged with the real mouse (or the physical gamepad's right stick) → USB raw_gadget
userspace device stack (generic HID mouse / Xbox 360 pad / P5 General pad) → game
```

Three mutually exclusive output modes (`-M`): **hid** emits the corrections on the generic USB mouse
(path above); **pad** passes a physical Xbox-layout gamepad through and merges the law's desired
velocity onto its right stick, presenting the emulated **wired Xbox 360 pad** (VID/PID
`0x045E/0x028E`) so the host's own XInput stack reads it as a controller (see "Pad mode"); **p5g** is
that same gamepad input/merge/calibration chain aimed at the **PS5**: the board presents itself as the
**P5 General dongle-shaped device** (VID/PID `0x2B81/0x0101`) over raw_gadget while the **real P5
General dongle** — plugged into one of the board's own host ports — signs every 64-byte input report
over hidraw before it goes on the wire, and the PS5's auth challenge/response (feature reports
`0xF0`/`0xF1`/`0xF2`) is forwarded verbatim (see "P5 output").

**No hand-tuned gains inside the law; one hand-supplied physical scale per output mode.** The law's
constants are principle-derived and its bandwidth follows the *measured* delay
(`wn=(90−PM)π/180/L̂`, PM=50° from the test suite); what the operator supplies is the game's own input
sensitivity — the one physical quantity the firmware cannot observe, since calibration measures the
loop delay only. Auto-calibration is triggered by holding an operator key for 5 s (hid: both mouse
side keys; pad/p5g: L3+R3, or the panel's button) and measures **only the loop delay L (ms)** online;
**each output mode owns a slot of five hand-editable values in the game script** — its delay plus four
per-axis pull-speed ratios — so switching `-M` switches the whole slot, and a calibration or a save
touches that slot alone: `HID_L_EST`/`PAD_L_EST`/`P5G_L_EST` and
`<mode>_SPDX`/`_SPDY`/`_ADS_SPDX`/`_ADS_SPDY` (`--spd`/`--ads-spd` — effective sensitivity =
baseline / (ratio/100), so 100 is the baseline and a larger ratio pulls faster — its correct value is
the one where the assumed sensitivity matches the real one, i.e. where the loop sits at its design
point, and the law's proven mismatch envelope is ±30% (arena `s0.7–1.3`), so dialling faster than the
game's true sensitivity spends phase margin). The control tick is 1 kHz (`DEFAULT_FREQ`). Adapts to
PC / PS5 / 60fps / 120fps.

**Control law**: the firmware (`src/main.cpp` with `src/core/` and `src/io/`) uses **ff_pi_acc**
(pole-placement PI + type-2 velocity feedforward with direction-contradiction CUSUM velocity reset and
detection-gap FF decay, plus an innovation-mean â channel that removes the α-β structural lag on
accelerating targets) — the convergence bandwidth `wn` is derived from the calibrated delay `L` via
phase margin (`wn=(90°−PM)π/180/L`, PM=50°), **no hand-tuned numbers inside the law**. The same binary
has **optional training-data collection** (enabled with `-o`, otherwise pure aimbot). All control-law
exploration/comparison/tuning happens in the pure-Python `arena/` simulation, which is
platform-independent and needs no board.

## Author's requirements (binding)

The author's standing requirements for this repository. They are not style preferences: a
change that violates one is rejected even when its measured benefit is real. Read this
section before editing anything.

**1. The library reads as if it had been written in one go.** No patch-style narration, no
version comparison, no timeline or provenance voice — not in this file, not in docstrings,
not in code comments. Forbidden: "patch 1 …", "this version improves on the previous one",
"recently added", "the old implementation was …", "a debugging round on <date> found …".
Required instead: design rationale and measured numbers stated as standing facts ("the cap
is a physical requirement because …"), and rejected paths recorded as conclusions ("a
persistently faster gain is forbidden: …") — never as a history of who changed what when.

> 作者原话: "让整个库看起来'像是一次性写出来的'，意思就是不要有什么补丁1：xxxx patch2：
> xxxx 这个版本相比上个版本提升了xxxx之类的话……总之库要是干净的整洁的。"

**2. No magic numbers.** Every constant traces to one of three things: an explicit physical
quantity, a reproducible derivation, or a written-down selection rule. Forbidden: thresholds
produced by tuning with no criterion and no provenance, and compromises found on a single
scenario. The accepted form is already used throughout — `PRED_BETA0=0.03` is labelled
"band-edge margin", `ACC_SNR=10` "the smallest whole value holding the whole delay and s
band bit-exact", `PM=50` "chosen by the mismatch-band test suite", `FF_PM_DEG`/`FF_ZETA`
dimensionless design choices with the reason stated. Corollary, and the reason this matters:
a number no command can reproduce — typically one that came from an experimental file since
deleted — must either gain a reproduction path or be removed, or be rewritten as a
qualitative statement without it. The rule binds *constants*: the operator's speed scale (see
Tuning) is an input, not a constant — its baseline carries provenance and its value is the
game's business.

> 作者原话: "不能有'魔法数字'。……没有什么经过无数次微调得到的那种魔法数字。"

**3. The result is what counts, and method-level change is welcome.** Anything that measures
better is acceptable, including structural change — replacing the estimator or the law, or
adding a mechanism of the CUSUM kind. A rewrite is not required; but knob-tuning alone is the
weakest available option, not the target. What is *not* acceptable is an unsourced constant
added for feel (requirement 2).

> 作者原话: "我不管你怎么做，我只要最后结果好。"

**4. The evaluation groups are the contract.** A change ships only after passing all of:
`arena.eval` (matched composite, worst mismatch over L30–70, and the 60/120 fps delta must
not rise), `arena.integrate` (no divergence anywhere in the wide delay band L20–80 or s
0.7–1.3 — divergence loses outright, however fast the scheme), `arena.fps_eval` (neither the
clean nor the flaky `drop_p=0.12` variant may get worse; the per-phase air / dash / slide
tables are the focus), and `arena.selftest`. Experiment in `arena/laws/_wip_*.py`; a shared
evaluation group or the shipped law is never edited to accommodate an experiment.

**5. Mismatch and flakiness are tested for anything claiming to be faster.** Any "faster /
more aggressive" mechanism reports its behaviour across the mismatch band *and* under flaky
detection. A scheme that wins at matched and breaks in either place is not a candidate.

**6. Reproduce before believing; report numbers, not intentions.** Re-derive the baseline of
whatever is about to change before touching it, and do not accept a number in this file as
fact without re-running its command — the figures here are measurements with reproduction
paths, not axioms. After a change, re-run the full set above and list the files touched.
Keep what was measured, what is inferred from documentation, and what is still unverified
clearly apart; "should be better" is not a result — give a number or write "未验证".

**7. Documentation and code move together.** A changed constant, default, CLI flag or module
list updates its prose, its tables and its docstring defaults in the same edit.

**8. `src/` is edited in the Windows mirror, compiled and verified on the board over ssh.**
This machine cannot compile it (no aarch64 toolchain, no AXCL/RGA/librga, no HDMI receiver);
every `.cpp`/`.h` change needs `bash scripts/compile.sh` on the RK3588 board — which builds and
runs the five unit tests — and any claim about behaviour comes from that run, never from
reading the diff here.

## Environment

- This folder is a **Windows development mirror**; code editing only.
- Compile and run happen on the board: `ssh xiaoming10086@192.168.1.103`, deployment checkout at
  `~/rk3588-aimbot`. Layout (dev mirror matches deployment):

```

- **All scripts resolve paths from their own location** (`realpath "$0"`, walking up to `ROOT`),
  independent of the calling cwd. **The whole directory can be moved/renamed freely** without
  breaking anything — no hardcoded deployment paths; only system paths like `/usr`, `/dev`, `/sys`
  are absolute.
- `dataset/` is always at the **project root** (`$ROOT/dataset`, a sibling of `engine/` and
  `scripts/`); it never ends up inside `bin/` just because the binary lives there — `-o` receives an
  absolute path computed from the script location.
- **Deploy paths.** Windows mirror → GitHub (`Horanzy/rk3588-aimbot`, branch `main`): direct HTTPS
  fails, so `git -c http.sslBackend=openssl -c http.proxy=http://127.0.0.1:7897 push origin main`
  (plain `http.proxy` without the openssl backend fails the TLS handshake). Windows mirror → board:
  the board's own GitHub access is unreliable, so push straight to it —
  `git push ssh://xiaoming10086@192.168.1.103/home/xiaoming10086/rk3588-aimbot HEAD:refs/heads/deploy`
  and then on the board `git reset --hard deploy && git branch -D deploy` (never leave a temp branch
  behind on the board).
- **Platform prerequisites** are `scripts/setup_platform.sh` — one idempotent entry point called by
  both the launcher and the panel, covering the three things this repository consumes but does not
  provide: **librga** (installed from upstream at the pinned `1.10.6_[3]` and read back for
  verification), **raw_gadget** (module load + `/etc/modules-load.d` persistence + `/dev/raw-gadget`
  permissions + vacating the UDC) and **axcl** (verified only — the library directory and
  `/dev/axcl_host`; the NPU runtime belongs to the board's BSP image). Device-tree or kernel-config
  changes are **not** part of it: the HDMI receiver node (`rk_hdmirx`), the in-kernel `rga3` driver
  and the AXCL host driver are image facts. Record such findings as notes here, not as script steps.
- The board image's own facts, for when a prerequisite fails: receiver node
  `/sys/class/video4linux/videoN/name` = `stream_hdmirx` (driver `rk_hdmirx`; the node number is not
  stable across reboots, which is why the default is name resolution), `raw_gadget` loadable with
  `/dev/raw-gadget` present, `/dev/rga` present (rga3 built into the kernel), the axcl runtime in
  `/usr/lib/axcl` with its modules loaded from the BSP's own
  `/etc/modules-load.d/axcl_pcie.conf`.
- All scripts and the panel use **LF** line endings (`.gitattributes` forces them; the board's `bash`
  does not accept CRLF/BOM).

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/main.cpp` | **The program entry**: argument parsing (including the output mode `-M hid` mouse / `-M pad` XInput pad / `-M p5g` P5 General pad), capture-device resolution (`-d` accepts only a `/dev/videoN` path; anything else is ignored with a note, since this platform has one built-in receiver and no by-id node), the one output-backend start (each mode owns the UDC), thread spawn and the 1 kHz timerfd control loop (`DEFAULT_FREQ`). The gamepad channel (input thread, merge/ledger routing, `CAL_MODE_PAD`, the pad tick) is entered whenever the mode is not `hid`; only the start/stop call is switched on the mode name. The law's frame-length scale is read from `src_fps()` every tick, so the receiver's own timing takes effect the moment it reports it. Exit uses `_Exit` — the axcl libraries abort in static destruction (measured RC=134) after the output has already been printed. Full aimbot + optional training-data collection (`-o`); without `-o` it is pure aimbot |
| `src/core/control.cpp/.h` | ff_pi_acc header constants (PRED_*/FF_*/CUSUM_*/ACC_* — pole-placement PI + type-2 velocity feedforward with direction-contradiction CUSUM velocity reset, detection-gap FF decay, gated â acceleration-bias compensation; wn derived from L, no hand tuning) + the two control-tick entry points: `control_apply` (hid — quantises to counts and writes the report's displacement bytes, recording `g_counts`) and `control_apply_pad` (delivers the desired velocity in px/ms and skips that tail). The per-axis speed caps are `min(-x, A_eff/1000)` for pad (full deflection is that axis's travelling range) and collapse to the single `-x` for hid, and the own-motion ledger's source and ledger→pixel scale are taken from `io/pad_output` (mode routing) |
| `src/core/estimator.cpp/.h` | α-β filter + direction-contradiction CUSUM + innovation-mean â sensor (`estimator_step`, driven per frame by the capture thread; publishes `g_target`); the three own-motion conversions inside it (prediction subtraction, innovation cleaning, own-acceleration activity gate) take one per-frame snapshot of the ledge source and per-axis scale from `io/pad_output` |
| `src/core/calib.cpp/.h` | the calibration **sampling** layer, independent of camera and model: the fixed sampling geometry (a 640×640 centre crop of the captured frame, grayscale-downscaled with INTER_AREA to a 320×320 half-resolution correlation domain — `CAL_SAMPLE_PX`, `CALIB_SAMPLE_SCALE` = 2 — split into 3×3 blocks of ≈106 correlation px), the **axial 1-D projection phase correlation** `calib_pc1d` (each block projected along the excitation axis, whitened cross spectrum, three-point parabolic sub-pixel peak) and the per-frame block statistics `calib_axis_stats` (stationary-cluster rejection at 0.5× the largest block shift → median displacement plus response/spread quality, with the pre-rejection median kept for the log), the per-frame `CalibSampler` and `persist_calibration` (atomic script write-back under the VAR name the caller passes — one name per output mode; a line written as the template's `${VAR:-…}` guard keeps its guard, only the default slot's value changes, and a trailing inline comment survives). The header carries the measured 1-D-vs-2-D comparison that chose the projection (0.90 vs 5.19 ms/frame, ±0.01 vs −0.04…−0.15 px on real signal texture, 0.54 vs 0.31 peak at a 60 px shift, identical HUD rejection and cross-axis leakage — the same comparison's definitions are reproduced on synthetic frames by `build/calib_test`'s `[3]` section) and the reliable-shift bound (half the block's screen-domain width = 106 px/frame). Capture-device resolution lives in the capture layer (`io/hdmi_in.h`), not here |
| `src/core/detect.cpp/.h` | the portable half of detection output: the minimal tensor shape/element-type description, output-layout parsing (rank 2/3 attribute tables and the rank-4 unfolded DFL head), the class-count rule and the four decode paths + NMS. **No platform dependency and no backend header** — it consumes bare `float` tensors. `anchor_count(S) = Σ(S/8)²` over three levels; `head_kind` decides by **physical geometry first** (num==3G → YOLOv5, num==G → YOLOv8-11), falling back — only when geometry is absent — to "attributes last and exactly 6 → end-to-end proposal table", else the objectness distinction against the configured class count |
| `src/core/state.cpp/.h` | shared globals: system constants (`DEFAULT_FREQ`, `CAP_SIZE`, `FOV_RADIUS`, `HOT_CTL_PORT`, `TICK_MS`), `ms_to_ticks` (durations are wall-clock, ticks are derived), the **pull-speed ratio scale** (`spd`: integer, 100 = baseline, effective sensitivity = baseline/k — the single definition point of the hid per-axis effective `s` (`s_hid_now`), of the pad full-deflection screen speed (`gain_pad_eff`), of the clamp both entry points use, and of the ADS-pair switch with its exported key state `g_ads_down`), `TargetState`/`CountsHistory`/`MouseState`, hot-param & calibration atomics (`g_calib_collect`/`g_calib_request`/`g_calib_done`/`g_padcalib_request`), time helpers, async save queue, signal |
| `src/core/control_test.cpp` | `build/control_test` unit test (built and run by `compile.sh`): the pull-speed ratio's landing points — spd=100 is the baseline (1 count = 1 px at the hid base), per-axis independence, the ADS pair switching on the very tick the right key is held, and the three consumers (injection, in-flight compensation, the estimator's own-motion conversion) sharing one per-axis effective sensitivity; plus the clamp band and the hot-param path, and the calibration write-back — the whole file compared byte for byte: the value lands in the caller's VAR, the `${VAR:-…}` guard form and its inline comment survive, a bare line is rewritten bare and a missing line is appended |
| `src/core/detect_test.cpp` | `build/detect_test` unit test (built and run by `compile.sh`): layout parsing against the four real exported shapes, "the anchor count comes from the model's geometry" (the measured 2100/1344/3549/8400/10647 relations), the class-count rule and its fallback path (including the collision contract: a proposal table whose quota equals `G` or `3G` is read by the geometric rule, while the same layout without geometry falls to the 6-attribute rule — the test pins both sides), hand-computed expectations for each of the four decode branches, the DFL head's distribution expectation plus the bin-count judgement (`4·reg_max ∈ {32,64,128,…}`, with the 20-remainder collision rejected and a minimal `reg_max = 8` layout still decoding), and NMS |
| `src/io/hdmi_in.cpp/.h` | the capture layer for the board's HDMI RX: bare V4L2 MULTIPLANAR, zero copy (`mmap` + `EXPBUF` dmabuf), device resolved by node name (`hdmirx`) and re-checked against the driver's own `VIDIOC_QUERYCAP` self-description, format/stride/sizeimage taken from the driver and never recomputed, `STREAMON` only after the timing lock, the `low_latency` sysfs switch written before `STREAMON` with read-back verification, **dma-fence gating** (in low-latency mode `DQBUF` returns before the payload is complete — the fence on `buf.timecode.userbits` is the completion credential, and each frame's fd is closed), **newest-frame delivery** (drain the queue after `DQBUF`, keep one frame, return the rest; the supersede counter is the visible cost — and every frame taken out of the queue but not delivered is given back through one path that closes its dma-fence dup and re-queues the buffer, whether the newer frame replaced it or the drain loop abandoned it on a `DQBUF` error or a timestamp-type mismatch: the fence is a kernel dup per pull, so the abandoning exits are where a per-session fd leak would hide) with `HdmiDelivery::QueueOrder` kept as the measuring counterpart, and **lock-loss / stall detection with rearm** (a poll slice with no frame plus a failed `QUERY_DV_TIMINGS` = signal gone, detected within one slice rather than one full poll budget; the whole poll budget or a fence-timeout streak = stream stopped; both rebuild the session, failures are retryable so "source not powered" and "device broken" behave the same — keep waiting, never take the process down). Timestamps are checked once per session to be `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` (the whole latency metric depends on it). The measured blocks (frame rate, delivery latency split into fence wait + userspace overhead, newest-vs-queue frame age, the four-format buffer-size rule, the failure→rearm walk-through) live in the two headers with their reproduction commands |
| `src/io/rga_pp.cpp/.h` | the RGA crop/format stage: the **centre 1:1 crop** of the captured dmabuf into a `dma_heap/system` destination (RGA and CPU share the same buffer), one `improcess()` per crop, no scaling (srect and drect are the same size — asserted as an invariant). The canonical window is `CAP_SIZE` (640) on a side; a smaller model input is a **second** centre crop of that window, produced by the same call with a different source. Buffer sizes follow one rule (source geometry in V4L2's units: bytesperline converted to a pixel stride, `sizeimage` as the whole frame), which makes the RGA-required size exactly the driver's `sizeimage` for all four formats. Destination buffers are `dma_heap/system` (cache-invalidate after each write, since that heap's CPU mapping is cached while RGA writes by DMA); allocation failure is a hard error, never a fallback to userspace memory. `wrapbuffer_fd_t` is called explicitly rather than through the variadic form so a geometry mistake cannot compile silently. The measured per-geometry cost and the byte-for-byte comparison against a CPU reference are in the header |
| `src/io/npu_axcl.cpp/.h` | the AXCL (AX650N card) inference session and one tick: a **synchronous H2D → execute → D2H** path only (an async call followed by a sync one on the same context segfaults, RC=139, so the two paths cannot coexist and the tick's cost is the sum of the three segments). **Input contract: U8 / NHWC / RGB `[1,S,S,3]`, `S ∈ {256,320,416,640}`** — the converted models carry dequantise → normalise → transpose themselves, so the host feeds raw RGB bytes; the contract is **read from the runtime's own description** at `open()` (dims + dtype; the runtime's `layout` field contradicts its `dims` and is logged only), and the channel order was confirmed by comparing the dumped input tensor against the original ONNX's input convention (cosine similarity 0.9989 RGB vs 0.9950 BGR). Only outputs whose layout parses (rank 2/3 grid/proposal tables, rank 4 unfolded DFL heads) get host staging and a per-frame D2H; the rest get device buffers only (execute requires one) and **not a byte crosses PCIe**. The header states the measured numerical property of self-converted outputs — coordinates and confidences share one quantised tensor, so the codeword length becomes the confidence resolution (apex 1.4915, codwz 1.6453, Z320 1.3031, Dawan 1.2502, R6 3.4864; R6's whole objectness/class channel lands on code 0 → 0 candidates in this layer against 7765 candidates >0.5 from the same input through the original ONNX, while the public HuggingFace DFL model is unaffected at a codeword of 0.21). The values are taken as they come — no compensation — and `model_probe` prints the codeword and the score-channel range into the acceptance output; the conversion-side fix is to split the head into two tensors, one per range. Buffers are allocated once and reused per frame (per-frame allocation would inject jitter into the control loop), and the input is packed into host memory first so the H2D source never depends on someone else's cache maintenance. The transfer-size sweep's least-squares fit (H2D 105–138 µs + 1854–1865 µs/MB, D2H 74–86 µs + 1494–1508 µs/MB, residual ≤7.2%) gives the budget's fixed cost and per-byte rate |
| `src/io/capture.cpp/.h` | capture/inference orchestration: frame (io/hdmi_in) → RGA crop/format (io/rga_pp) → one NPU tick (io/npu_axcl) → translate detections back into the window domain → NMS → FOV target selection → `estimator_step` publishes `g_target`; plus the calibration sampling path (the whole inference chain is skipped while `g_calib_collect`), the three-source screenshot collection and the preview. Defines the **coordinate domain**: the canonical window is the centre 1:1 crop with side `W = max(CAP_SIZE, model side)`, and a smaller model input is a second centre crop whose translation back is `(W − model_side)/2` — one conversion, in one place. A 640 BGR window is produced **on demand** (only a screenshot, a calibration round or an open preview needs it), so the steady state is one RGA crop per frame. `src_fps()` carries the receiver's locked timing to everyone who needs a frame-length scale; `SRC_FPS_DEFAULT` covers only the window before the receiver opens. **Source loss never ends the process** (the signal is an external condition, and only a live process can be there when the picture returns); an unopenable inference chain is a configuration fact and ends the run. Log lines the panel parses are a contract: `模型: <arch> <side>x<side>[ <classes>类]`, `[AI FPS] …`, `采集统计: fire=… det=… auto=…`, `收帧统计: …`, `[HDMI] …`, `[SAVE] …`, `[标定] …`. It is also where the round's write-back value is composed: it accumulates the **inference leg** (`pack + H2D + exec + D2H + decode`, i.e. the segment `[AI FPS]` already reports) over the frames that ran the whole chain, and on a successful round writes `L_physical + inference_average` into the mode's delay VAR, logging the physical `L`, the averaged leg with its frame count and the sum (a cold start writes the physical value alone and says so). The frame-wait and RGA legs are not added — the round pays them itself |
| `src/io/calib_run.cpp/.h` | **the shared calibration engine for all three output modes** (one measurement method, one state machine, one fit — a mode supplies only the excitation plan, the injection units and the write-back VAR name; the deliverable is `L` only): the plan table (`cal_plan`, hid = 2 pairs × 2 axes, pad = 3 pairs × the horizontal axis, signs alternating so the picture returns to its start, every excitation followed by a 300 ms zero-command pause), the segment-window table, the online travel accumulator (`cal_note_sample` → `g_cal_live_travel`/`g_cal_live_slot`, read by the state machine's to-target stop rule), the fit (`cal_fit`), the diagnostics and the write-back — the observation model, the three readings, every gate's source and the state machine are stated in the "Calibration" section below. The 1 kHz tick of that mode (`cal_step`) plays the plan, aborts an axis after two consecutive timeouts while keeping its pauses as the σ pool, and ends with nod/shake; success writes **the caller's delay VAR — `HID_L_EST` (hid) / `PAD_L_EST` (pad) / `P5G_L_EST` (p5g): one slot per output mode, so pad and p5g share the excitation plan but never each other's delay**; the value written is the caller's (the engine's own `l_est` is the physical leg, and `cal_writeback` takes the composed complete-loop value as an argument, so the script and the running law hold one number) |
| `src/io/usbraw.cpp/.h` | raw_gadget session carrier: sysfs two-level UDC name discovery (the gadget name is read from the sysfs uevent — the platform driver's name and the gadget name are not the same string, and binding with the wrong one is refused by the kernel) → INIT/RUN/VBUS_DRAW (the VBUS request is the configuration's `bMaxPower`, uapi unit 2 mA); the ep0 standard-request table (descriptors truncated to `wLength`, status/configuration/interface/feature; OUT or zero-length SETUPs closed through EP0_READ), device-specific requests answered by an optional per-device hook, unanswered ones STALLed — an unanswered SETUP would leave the kernel's ep0 stage pending and fail every later control transfer of the session; the interrupt-IN **latest-report slot** send thread (EP_WRITE length = submitted length — a short packet is a packet boundary) and an optional interrupt-OUT receive thread (EP_READ blocking, packets have no consumer and are dropped). Report rate = min(tick rate, host service rate) — the slot holds one state, not a queue, so the host sees exactly one report per report the producer submitted and no submission can turn into two host-visible reports, while a producer faster than the host has its extra submissions coalesced. Every 60 s the send thread prints **both layers** of that rate — submissions/s (the device-side production cadence) and write completions/s with their mean interval (the cadence at which the host takes reports) — under the device's own tag (`[USB-HID]` / `[PAD-USB]`); equal numbers mean no backlog, a lower completion rate means the host's polling ceiling (endpoint `bInterval` × enumeration speed) or host scheduling is the bottleneck. The same line carries the OUT received count: it is the existence observable for the host's own commands (LED/force-feedback traffic is real and low-rate). The 60 s window is reopened when a gap (disconnect / suspend / the host pausing its polling) exceeds 100 ms, so a pause is never counted as slow polling. Session parameters come from the device definition: enumeration speed (which sets the time unit of the endpoint `bInterval`), device qualifier (nullptr = none, that GET_DESCRIPTOR STALLs — the spec behaviour of full-speed-only devices; a high-speed device answers it), VBUS request, descriptor set, endpoint set and class-request semantics. The OUT endpoint's enable/retire handshake is the kernel's own constraint: EP_ENABLE needs the endpoint disabled and no request in flight (`urb_queued` → `EINVAL`), and only the reading thread can observe an in-flight request end, so retirement wakes the reader, waits for it to leave the read, then disables — an enabled-but-unread OUT endpoint NAKs the host's command transfers forever. Shutdown wakes the threads blocked in endpoint ioctls with a no-op signal: those in-flight ioctls hold a file reference, so closing the fd alone cannot drive the UDC release. An open failure names its two causes separately (module absent / permissions) with the `scripts/setup_platform.sh` reminder, and `EBUSY` on RUN prints the UDC-vacating reminder |
| `src/io/hid_mouse.cpp/.h` | real-mouse input and USB mouse identity: evdev read (EVIOCGRAB; device picked by `-D`, default = lexicographically first `*-event-mouse` so the choice is deterministic, an explicit substring matching several nodes is an error listing the candidates, an absolute `/dev/input/eventN` path is taken as-is — which is how a uinput synthetic mouse is selected) + the USB mouse device definition (device/config/report descriptors — the report descriptor is the single source of truth for the 9-byte report layout; the identity is the kernel's generic gadget IDs `1d6b:0104` — a mouse is bound by HID class on every host, so a vendor identity would carry no information, and this one is the identity the deployment host's HID stack is already bound to, keeping its pointer settings in force) + per-tick report assembly submitted into the raw_gadget session's latest-report slot (control counts merged via the overlay callback) |
| `src/io/pad_input.cpp/.h` | gamepad input: evdev gamepad read (`-P` by-id substring, falling back to a name+capability scan over `/dev/input/event*` because uinput/Bluetooth pads have no by-id node), capability bitmap verified per device (axis family `RX/RY` vs `Z/RZ` chosen from the bitmap, trigger axes from the same bitmap, ranges from absinfo — nothing hardcoded), Xbox-layout `PadLogical` state, disconnect self-heal (clear keys + 1 s reopen retry, non-blocking at startup), and the **sibling event nodes**: every `/dev/input/event*` whose `EVIOCGID` VID:PID matches the joystick node's is opened too and only its `EV_KEY` events are consumed through `pad_extra_key_bit` (measured: the G7 Pro exposes joystick + keyboard + mouse from one USB device and its share/upload button emits `KEY_SYSRQ` on the keyboard node with the joystick node seeing nothing at all, so reading the joystick node alone silently loses it). The P5 General dongle's own node is excluded from the candidates by VID/PID (`0x2B81:0x0101`) — it is the p5g mode's authentication peripheral, not a human channel. The **8-bit→16-bit mapping** is a uniform-step expansion table (midpoint exactly 0, 254 steps of 258 plus one endpoint-absorbed step of 1) with an independently written golden table in the unit test — see "Pad mode" below for the rule and its numbers |
| `src/io/pad_output.cpp/.h` | the gamepad merge layer (shared by both gamepad output backends): law velocity → right-stick injection conversion `d = v·1000/A_eff` per axis with `A_eff = gain_pad_eff(spd_axis(ads, axis))`, merge with the human stick and radial clamp to the full-scale circle, the stick ledger `Σ(deflection·ms)` (the pad counterpart of the `g_counts` invariant: what the game actually received) with its per-axis ledger→pixel factor `s_rp = A_eff/(32767·1000)`, the `own_motion_ledger`/`own_motion_scale` mode routing (hid = `g_counts` × per-axis effective sensitivity, pad = the stick ledger × per-axis `s_rp`), the `g_pad_publish` latest-slot publish point the output backend polls, the **per-axis speed cap** `min(-x, A_eff/1000)`, the 1 kHz pad tick (snapshot → RT/LT trigger word → **calibration step** (`io/calib_run.h`; while a round runs the excitation owns the whole pad — `pad_excite` writes the excitation on the right stick and centres the human share of both sticks *and* both triggers, keeping the button word so L3/R3 still reach the game: a held left stick translates the whole picture and a trigger can put the game into an aiming state, either of which changes the very response being measured, and neither shows up in the pause windows where σ is read → law velocity → merge+ledger → publish) and `--pad-dump` (a `[PAD]` line every ≥50 ms: the merged state plus `fire`/`ads`/`aim_gate` — during a round it traces the excitation waveform) |
| `src/io/pad_xinput.cpp/.h` | pad-mode output backend: the wired Xbox 360 pad's device bytes (`0x045E/0x028E`, vendor interface FF/5D/01, interrupt IN 0x81 + OUT 0x02 both 32 B, the 16-byte `0x21` vendor descriptor Windows' enumeration needs, no HID report descriptor) and the 20-byte input report encoder (explicit `u8[20]`: header `00 14`, int16 LE sticks, 0–255 triggers, button bits; the wire's Y is up-positive while `PadLogical`'s is up-negative) plus the report loop submitting every control tick into the session's latest-report slot. **Enumeration speed and endpoint `bInterval` together are the terminal refresh rate** (USB 2.0 §9.6.6): the shipped pair is **high speed + `bInterval=4`** (`2^3` microframes = 1 ms = 1000 Hz), with the device qualifier a high-speed device must answer; the device-definition header carries the measurement that pins the pair (a full-speed `bInterval=1` definition declares the same 1000 Hz ceiling and completes writes at the same rate, but the host's XInput *state* does not follow it, while the high-speed definition matches field for field). The OUT endpoint is enabled and drained so the host's own LED/force-feedback commands have a consumer — an enabled-but-unread OUT endpoint makes those transfers time out. **The serial number is derived per machine** (FNV-1a-64 of `/etc/machine-id`, falling back to the dbus machine id then the hostname → 12 uppercase hex digits): the host derives its device instance id from it, so a fixed public constant would both collide across units and hand out a recognisable device fingerprint; derived-not-random keeps one identity across reboots and re-plugs, and the derivation excludes the descriptor bytes because a definition change does not need a new instance (the host re-reads the descriptors on every arrival) |
| `src/io/pad_p5g.cpp/.h` | p5g-mode output backend (PS5): the board presents the **P5 General dongle-shaped device** (0x2B81/0x0101, full speed, single HID interface, interrupt IN 0x82 64 B @1 ms + OUT 0x01 64 B @6 ms, 165-byte report descriptor — a byte-exact clone of the GP2040-CE reference firmware's descriptors, every constant documented in `docs/p5general/`) and drives the **real dongle** plugged into a host port via its hidraw node (`/sys/bus/hid/devices/0003:2B81:0101.*/hidraw/*`: interrupt IN = read, interrupt OUT = write, feature control transfers = `HIDIOCS/GFEATURE`). The PS5's auth handshake is forwarded verbatim (SET_REPORT 0xF0 challenge → dongle; GET_REPORT 0xF1 signature/nonce and 0xF2 signing state ← dongle; the reference state machine's dispatch table — f1 quotas 4/1/0 by challenge type, the +500 ms auto-F2, the one-GET-behind read semantics, the idle-only F0 acceptance — is followed rule for rule), and the signing pipeline submits every merged report to the dongle and sends the PS5 **only the bytes the dongle returned** (change-driven + 4 repeats + a single report in flight, all reference rules; the reference's drop-on-backpressure branch is realized structurally rather than exercised: a returned report goes straight into the session's latest-report slot, which overwrites rather than queues, so nothing accumulates to drop). Three deliberate deviations from the reference, all robustness additions that keep the protocol semantics: a failed transfer abandons the round to idle instead of hanging in a wait state forever (the reference's documented dead end — the PS5's own timeout re-sends the challenge and the round restarts), dongle loss closes the hidraw and rescans on a 1 s cycle (the reference never resets its state machine on unplug), and the signature round trip carries a 500 ms watchdog — the same budget the reference firmware grants the dongle for its auto-F2, i.e. its own longest explicit wait. The ep0 class-request segment routes to the device's hook (see `usbraw`): GET_REPORT(0x03) answers the 48-byte static definition, unknown feature IDs STALL. Watchdog-free of tuning knobs: every timing constant cites the reference's own 500 ms dongle budget; the trigger's wire digital bit gates at 16/255 (first whole value above the measured G7 Pro trigger flat of 15/255 — the same measurement the `padthr` default cites), the analog value itself passes through untouched |
| `src/io/pad_test.cpp` | `build/pad_test` unit test (built and run by `compile.sh`): the 8-bit→16-bit mapping (neutral exactly 0, endpoints exactly ±32767, monotone, centred devices passing through, trigger scaling), the injection/merge geometry (linear per-axis `v/A_eff`, radial clamps, the ledger booking the post-clamp value and its unit identity with `s_rp`), pass-through 1:1, the trigger threshold and `-k` gate, the **per-axis speed cap** `min(-x, A_eff/1000)` (saturating command landing exactly on the cap, per-axis independence, the cap moving with the ratio), the ledger routing and per-axis `own_motion_scale` (including the ADS pair switching), the publish-point contract, the XInput wire format (header, button bit tables, trigger pass-through, int16 LE assembly and the Y convention, the touchpad bit having no XInput landing spot) and the device bytes (identity, 48 B configuration, the `0x21` blob, both endpoints, the qualifier, high-speed enumeration, the poll-rate derivation `8000 >> (bInterval−1) = 1000 Hz`, the 20-byte report fitting one packet, the derived 12-digit serial, and the configuration's endpoint bytes matching the `EP_ENABLE` descriptors byte for byte); plus the **P5G side**: the 8-bit wire map's round-trip identity over all 256 codes (with the rejected `(v+32768)>>8` form's 127 failures counted beside it), the injection landing (`floor(inject/258)` whole steps, hand-computed expectations, floor/arithmetic-shift rounding at the step boundary, both merged-clamp ends), the 64-byte report encoding byte by byte, the device bytes (identity, 41 B configuration, both endpoints, the 165-byte report descriptor's structural anchors across its whole length, the 8-bit stick declaration at its exact offsets, the hook, the `PAD-USB` rate tag), the auth state machine on a synthetic dongle (verbatim forwarding, the 4/1/0 dispatch table, auto-F2 timing, one-GET-behind reads, idle-only acceptance, failure-abandon recovery, reset and absent-dongle semantics) and the signing pipeline (change-driven submits, repeat quota, single in-flight, drop-on-backpressure, the pending watchdog); plus the sibling-interface key translation and the 8/16-bit resolution comparison, and the absent-device path (non-blocking, no report) |
| `src/core/calib_test.cpp` | `build/calib_test` unit test (built and run by `compile.sh`): sampling geometry invariants (centred unscaled crop, scale factor, correlation-domain size, reliable shift bound, edge quantization floor), the block statistics on synthetic frames (injected-equals-recovered, a stationary HUD majority hijacking the plain median to ≈0 while the rejected median stays exact, a minority of static blocks, the single-outlier fallback, the scale-free rejection threshold, the untextured-frame path), the 1-D-vs-2-D comparison (both implementations, error and cost), the state machine (plan shape and amplitudes, the trigger hold, the start cross not sampling, the to-target stop, the unresponsive-axis abort and its bounded round length, the printed plan span vs the trigger-inclusive historical depth, the pure-pass-through reset, the per-round verdict reset, the `padcalib` re-entrancy drop) and the **synthetic closed-loop e2e** — a virtual game with a known `L` (optional first-order lag, detection noise, dropped frames, 60/120 fps, and a per-axis `L` so the two axes can disagree) driven through the real state machine and fit, printing and asserting each case's deviation and scatter, including the two two-axis chains (a 30 ms axis difference fails the round on the tail family's dispersion gate while both per-axis medians are still reported; a 4 ms one succeeds with the written value at the whole-round median) — plus the honesty paths (frozen screen, noise-only screen, a tail longer than the pause → a failed round, no write-back, the script's VAR untouched) and the three output slots (a successful round writes `PAD_L_EST` with its guard intact while the other two slots stay byte-identical, the p5g name lands in its own slot, and the value that lands is the caller's composed complete-loop delay, not the engine's physical `l_est`) |
| `src/io/hdmi_test.cpp` | `build/hdmi_test` unit test (built and run by `compile.sh`): the capture layer's **fail-direction** predicates — which failures need a rebuild and which are just a dropped frame, the consecutive-fence-timeout line (queue depth − 1), the rearm cadence, the giveaway contract for a pulled-but-undelivered frame (only delivery does not return it, and both abandoning exits do), and the derivation relations between the constants. It touches no device: the real lock-loss → re-lock → picture-returns walk is accepted by `build/hdmi_probe` and by the `[HDMI]` lines of a live aimbot run |
| `src/io/hotctl.cpp/.h` | UDP hot-parameter channel 127.0.0.1:47700 (`hotctl_apply` is the pure key/value apply step — testable without a socket) |
| `scripts/compile.sh` | the board build: g++ per-TU objects into `build/`, `bin/aimbot` linked from them, then the **five** unit tests (`control_test`, `pad_test`, `calib_test`, `detect_test`, `hdmi_test`) and three probes (`hdmi_probe`, `model_probe`, `pipeline_probe`) — the tests are run by the script and a failing assertion aborts the whole build; the probes are built but not run (they need root, the card and a live signal). axcl and librga are the deployment machine's system libraries; `scripts/setup_platform.sh` provides the latter and verifies the former |
| `scripts/setup_platform.sh` | the single platform-setup entry point, called by both the launcher template and the panel before every start, idempotent and safe to re-run: librga (fetch upstream → verify the pinned `1.10.6_[3]` from the header macros **and** from the version string compiled into the prebuilt `.so` → install to `/usr/local` → read back and verify) + raw_gadget (module load, `/etc/modules-load.d/raw-gadget.conf` persistence, `/dev/raw-gadget` permissions, vacating the UDC) + axcl (verify the `/usr/lib/axcl` libraries and `/dev/axcl_host`; a missing node is retried once with `modprobe axcl_host`). Failure anywhere aborts with the reason, because the firmware cannot start without them; the script also reports the `/dev/rga` state, which RGA jobs need |
| `scripts/game/template.sh.example` | Per-game launcher template — copy to `<game>.sh` (`.example` keeps the panel from listing it as a launchable profile). Relative paths; calls `scripts/setup_platform.sh` first; output-mode switch `OUTPUT_MODE` ∈ {hid, pad, p5g} (hid expands `-D`, pad/p5g expand the same `-M <mode> -P -T` and `PAD_DUMP="y"` adds `--pad-dump` — the two gamepad modes differ only in that one value); mouse-takeover switch `AIM_ENABLED` and screenshot-collection switches (`CAPTURE` master + per-source `CAP_FIRE`/`CAP_DET`/`CAP_AUTO`); **three slots of five VARs** — `HID_*`, `PAD_*`, `P5G_*` — each holding that mode's delay (`<mode>_L_EST`, the calibration's write-back target — the **complete** loop delay: physical `L` plus the averaged inference leg, with the shared frame-wait/RGA legs deliberately not added) and its four pull-speed ratios (`<mode>_SPDX`/`_SPDY`/`_ADS_SPDX`/`_ADS_SPDY` → `--spd`/`--ads-spd`, integer, 100 = baseline, shipped default 75 at the 1440p deployment source) with the scale, the per-slot baseline (`hid` = 1.0 px/count, `pad`/`p5g` = 3000 px/s full deflection) and the swap rule explained in the file: the `case` takes the current mode's slot, so switching `OUTPUT_MODE` switches delay and ratios together and the three sets never mix; the ratios are manual entries the firmware never writes; every manual VAR is guarded (`${VAR:-default}`) so a script missing any of them still launches; the `MAX_SPEED` rule and its derivation live in the file. `CAM_DEV` takes a `/dev/videoN` path only (empty = the firmware resolves the receiver by driver name) and there is no frame-rate knob — the capture rate is the signal's |
| `scripts/test/hdmi_probe.cpp` | the capture layer's board acceptance probe: resolve the device → print the locked timing and format → capture N frames (default 600) and report the measured frame rate, the delivery latency split into fence wait and userspace overhead, the per-geometry RGA cost, drops, sequence gaps and ERROR returns → compare the crop against a pure-CPU reference written on the mmap'd capture buffer, byte for byte → dump PNGs for the eye. Flags: `--fifo` (queue-order delivery, the counterpart that measures what newest-frame semantics buy), `--slow <ms>` (simulate a consumer that cannot keep up), `--no-fence` (measurement only — reproduces "the payload is still being written when the frame is handed out"), `--dump <dir>`. It rebuilds on lock loss exactly as the production path does, so one long run *is* the lock-loss → re-lock → recovery acceptance. Run: `sudo ./build/hdmi_probe 600` |
| `scripts/test/model_probe.cpp` | the NPU acceptance probe for one `.axmodel`: print the runtime's **IO contract** per tensor (name/shape/element type/bytes/role — is the input U8 NHWC RGB, which outputs are kept and which are skipped and why), optionally run a real image through the whole chain (letterbox → RGB → H2D → inference → D2H → decode → NMS) and dump both the input tensor actually fed and each kept output's raw bytes for byte-level comparison elsewhere, report each kept output's **numerical measurement** (codeword length and score-channel range), and print the per-segment latency percentiles and the equivalent bandwidth over N iterations. `--xfer-sweep` does only the transfer-size sweep (percentiles per size + least-squares fit and residual), the foundation of the latency budget. The geometry matches AXERA's reference sample pixel for pixel; the channel order is the one deliberate difference (the reference feeds BGR, this repository's converted models carry an RGB contract). Run: `sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/axcl ./build/model_probe engine/<model>.axmodel --image <jpg>` |
| `scripts/test/pipeline_probe.cpp` | the capture → NPU end-to-end probe: runs the **production path itself** (`io/capture`'s `CapturePipeline`) against the live signal for the frame rate and per-segment cost, then pastes a real image into the centre window of one real capture buffer and pushes it through the same chain, dumping the window and annotated PNGs. Needs root, the card and a live signal |
| `scripts/test/uinput_pad_test.py` | gamepad-mode e2e on the board: synthesizes a virtual Xbox-layout gamepad via uinput (xpad-style axes, deliberately unlike the G7 Pro's HID-style bitmap, covering the axis-family branches) and asserts passthrough 1:1, trigger scaling, fire/ads gating, dpad, unplug/reconnect recovery against the aimbot's `--pad-dump` output (pure stdlib, run under sudo) — the dump reads the publish point, which is backend-independent, so the same assertions cover the whole input/merge chain and both gamepad backends (`--mode pad\|p5g`) |
| `scripts/test/uinput_calib_test.py` | calibration e2e on the board (pure stdlib, run under sudo): synthesizes the mode's trigger device (`--mode hid` = a virtual mouse whose `BTN_SIDE`+`BTN_EXTRA` are the side-key pair; `--mode pad\|p5g` = a virtual pad triggered with L3+R3) and drives one full round against the live signal, then asserts the four things a round must show — the trigger line, the plan playing with per-segment evidence, `--pad-dump` proving the pad is owned by the excitation (right stick deflecting, left stick and both triggers centred, L3/R3 still passing through), the round's measured sampling rate / capture rate / no-sample fraction / per-frame sampling cost, and the verdict with its write-back rule (on success the log must carry the physical `L` + inference average + written total line). A static screen (no game) is the expected failure here, and that is the assertion that matters most: the round must say why and leave the profile script byte-identical |
| `scripts/test/xinput_probe.ps1` | Windows-side verdict probe for the emulated pad: P/Invoke `xinput1_4.dll!XInputGetState`, polls the four user slots printing rc / packet number / decoded buttons+sticks+triggers (rc=1167 = slot empty; rc=0 with a rising packet = live device) — the acceptance instrument for "the host really is an XInput pad" (ASCII-only source so PowerShell 5.1 parses it without a BOM) |
| `scripts/test/pad_key_probe.py` | evdev key probe for the physical pad (pure stdlib, run under sudo, **with the aimbot stopped** — the reader owns the node via EVIOCGRAB): prints every `EV_KEY` code with its kernel name and whether `pad_input`'s table already maps it, so an unmapped button can be identified before it is wired to a logical bit; also flags the node itself (a pad's extra buttons can ride a second interface) and, with `--raw`, dumps `EV_ABS` |
| `scripts/test/p5g_dongle_probe.py` | P5 General dongle bring-up probe on the board (pure stdlib, run under sudo, read-only plus one OUT write — it never enters the auth handshake): enumerates the dongle's `/sys/bus/hid` form and bound driver, dumps its own HID report descriptor to `/tmp`, exercises the three feature control transfers (0x03 device definition / 0xF1 signature / 0xF2 signing state), then times the signing round trip (interrupt OUT write → interrupt IN return) over 8 submissions and prints the mean/fastest latency and the implied continuous-input ceiling. It also reports the raw_gadget + UDC readiness of the device port. Answers, on real hardware, the questions `docs/p5general/` §10 could only bound from the code |
| `docs/p5general/p5general-protocol.zh-CN.md` / `.en.md` | The P5 General wire protocol as the authority for every constant in `io/pad_p5g`: a line-referenced transcription of the GP2040-CE reference firmware (`P5GeneralDriver.cpp`, the descriptor arrays, the auth listener state machine) plus the hardware-verified descriptor bytes, the 64-byte input/output report layouts, the feature-report sequences and the §10 list of what the code alone could not settle (with the probe's measured answers in §14) |
| `webui/` | the browser control panel (FastAPI + vanilla JS): profile discovery from `scripts/game/*.sh`, model discovery from `engine/**/*.axmodel`, receiver discovery from `/sys/class/video4linux` with the live signal state (`v4l2-ctl --all`), the start sequence (`scripts/setup_platform.sh` → `bin/aimbot` with the full parameter set, `-S` pointing at the profile script), hot-param push, the calibration button, compile as an async task and the log stream. `webui/README.md` is the operator manual |
| `arena/` | Pure-Python control-law simulation evaluator (neutral simulator + 13 laws + standard + FPS test suites); see the dedicated section |
| `AGENTS.md` / `README.md` | the design document (this file: platform, files, parameters, architecture, invariants, tuning, arena) and its short entry point (platform, pipeline, output modes, build & run, parameter face) |
| `requirements.txt` | `arena/`'s two dependencies (numpy for Kalman/MPC, scipy for the DARE solve); the firmware itself needs nothing from Python |
| `.gitattributes` / `.gitignore` | LF enforcement (the board's `bash` rejects CRLF/BOM), and what stays on the deployment machine: `build/`, `bin/`, `engine/`, `dataset/`, `*.axmodel`, the panel's runtime state, `arena/trace_out/` and the private game scripts (only the template is committed) |

Linking note: the calibration's 2-D block-correlation baseline exists only in the unit test
(`cv::phaseCorrelate` in `src/core/calib_test.cpp`; the sampling side uses `cv::dft`/`cv::reduce`),
so `-lopencv_video` is a **unit-test link** requirement, while what `aimbot` itself needs is
`-lopencv_imgcodecs` (collection `imwrite`).

## Parameters

**aimbot** (missing `-m` fails fast on a missing model file; `-c`/`-n`/`-t`/`-y`/`-x`/`-k`/`-v` prompt
with a default — `-c` 0, `-n` 0, `-t` 0.5, `-y` 65, `-x` 2667, `-k` fire, `-v` n; every other flag has
a silent default — `-d` → resolve the receiver by driver name, `-r` → 200, `-l` → 60, `-S` → no
write-back, `-a` → y, `-M` → hid). The launcher template and the panel carry the same `-t`/`-y`/`-x`
defaults and pre-select `-a y -v n`; they widen the trigger key to `both` (`AIM_KEY`) because a profile
is per game, while the interactive default is the narrower `fire`. `-x` 2667 and `-r` 200 are **pixel
quantities, and pixels are resolution-bound**: they are the 1080p-reference derivation (2000 px/s, 150 px)
carried to the deployment source 2560×1440 by the resolution rule's R = 4/3 (see "Tuning") — the same rule
makes the shipped ratio default 75, not 100):

```
-m model  -c class (-1 = do not filter by class)  -n model class count (0 = derive from the attribute count)
-t confidence
-y height offset  -d capture device (/dev/videoN; default = resolve the receiver by driver name)
-x speed cap px/s (clamped 100–20000; default 2667 = the 1440p deployment landing)
-l initial L (that mode's calibration writes it back; 0–120; the value is the complete loop delay — the
   calibration's physical reading plus the averaged inference leg, see "Calibration")
-r FOV radius px (default 200 = the 1440p deployment landing, 10–1000)
-S write-back script path (calibration replaces the current output mode's delay line:
   HID_L_EST / PAD_L_EST / P5G_L_EST)
--spd <x>[,<y>] pull-speed ratio per axis — the game's input sensitivity in a percent scale
   (default 100 = baseline, larger = faster pull; effective sensitivity = baseline/(ratio/100);
   the correct value puts the loop at its design point, see "Tuning"; hot params spdx/spdy; the
   launcher/panel's shipped per-game default is 75 = the baseline carried to 1440p)
--ads-spd <x>[,<y>] the same pair while the ADS key (right button) is held (hot params adsspdx/adsspdy)
-a mouse takeover (default y; n = pure pass-through: no injected motion, detection/collection keep running)
-M hid|pad|p5g output mode (default hid; mutually exclusive — pad/p5g read the gamepad and never
   start the mouse session, hid never touches the gamepad; each owns the UDC, one at a time;
   p5g additionally requires the real P5 General dongle in a host port)
-P pad by-id substring (default empty = any *-event-joystick node; the P5 General dongle's own
   node is excluded by VID/PID)
-T pad trigger threshold in % of full scale (default 6 = the measured trigger flat 15/255; shared by
   RT and LT, hot param padthr; it gates the aim TRIGGER only — the analog trigger value still
   passes through 1:1, untouched)
--pad-dump adds the merged logical state to the log at ≥50 ms intervals (debug output on top of the
   live output); the launcher template carries it as PAD_DUMP="y" (the panel reads the same profile
   var and passes it through), so the command waveform can be captured from a normal panel launch
   without touching the CLI — it is how an injection that never reaches the game is told from a law
   that never commands one
-D mouse /dev/input/by-id substring or /dev/input/eventN (hid mode; default empty = lexicographically
   first *-event-mouse; an explicit substring matching several nodes errors out and lists them — a
   plugged-in gamepad's auxiliary mouse interface matches the default pattern too, so the real mouse
   gets named here)
-k trigger key (fire/ads/both)  -v preview (y/n)
```

**There is no frame-rate flag.** The capture rate is the signal's own property — the receiver's locked
timing sets it (`src_fps()`), and the only measurable rate is the detection rate on the `[AI FPS]`
line. The same reason removes any camera-selection vocabulary beyond a device node: this platform has
one built-in receiver, and `-d` takes a `/dev/videoN` path (anything else is ignored with a note, since
a by-id node does not exist here).

**Class count (`-n`)** is needed only by an **unfolded DFL head**, whose attribute count is
`4·reg_max + classes` and whose `reg_max` is not an observable physical quantity — so it is given
rather than guessed (the public YOLO11 export is 80). A grid head derives its class count from its own
attribute count, and `-n 0` means "derive". Without it a DFL output is simply not decoded.

**Pull-speed ratio scale** (`src/core/state.h` is its single definition point): the ratio is the
**pull-speed multiplier and is inverse to the effective sensitivity** — effective sensitivity =
baseline / k, `k = ratio/100`. A larger ratio assumes a lower game sensitivity, so the same desired
screen velocity emits more counts (a larger deflection) = the crosshair follows faster. Integers step by
one percent (`105`, `109`), **100 = the baseline**, and the baseline is the repository's own sensitivity
placeholder — the hid base is `1.0 px/count`, and the pad base is `3000 px/s` full deflection, set by
the written-down rule "the baseline is the reference title's measured full-deflection screen speed,
rounded up": a console shooter's measured 30–70 % deflection levels (193/556/1159/1651/1804 px/s)
extrapolate to ≈2600 px/s at full deflection, and 3000 is the next round value — one notch above the
speed-cap derivation's 2000 px/s, i.e. the same band. The clamp band is `[1, 10000]` (a typo guard,
shared by CLI and hot params); the meaningful band is `5..2000`, i.e. an effective sensitivity of
0.05–20 px/count. Per axis because a game's vertical/horizontal screen-speed ratio is a property of the
game (pitch sensitivity is usually lower) and one shared ratio would tie the axes together; the ADS pair
switches in as a whole on the tick the ADS key is held, and that key state is exported (`g_ads_down`) so
the frame-rate consumers (the estimator's own-motion conversion) use the same state. The ratio lands
**in the effective sensitivity** (not as an output-side multiplier) on purpose: the injection
conversion, the in-flight compensation and the estimator's own-motion conversion all consume the same
per-axis value, so a ratio change moves the command and its compensation together instead of
desynchronizing them. The speed cap (`-x`) keeps its value — it constrains whether the crosshair can
keep up with the target's screen velocity, a property of the game, not of the conversion scale. **The
ratios are a function of the source resolution**: a pixel is not an angle, so changing the capture
resolution changes which number is correct — see "Tuning" for the scaling rule and its worked example.
Both baselines are 1080p values, and the deployment source is 2560×1440, which is why the ratio default
the launcher template and the panel ship is `75` rather than `100` (the baselines themselves are not
rescaled: they are the rulers, and the shift belongs to the per-game number).

Hot params: the binary opens a localhost-only UDP control channel (127.0.0.1:47700, `key=value;...`);
the panel pushes whitelisted params (`t`/`y`/`x`/`fov`/`padthr`/`spdx`/`spdy`/`adsspdx`/`adsspdy`/`k`/
`aim`/`cap_fire`/`cap_det`/`cap_auto`, clamped firmware-side, plus the one-shot `padcalib=1` round
request) into the running process without restart — protocol in `webui/README.md`. Structural constants
stay compile-time.

**Parameter face (launcher + panel).** Every per-game value lives in the launcher script and the script
is the single source of truth: the panel parses the header VAR block on every scan (reading the guard's
effective value, not its literal text) and writes values back atomically, leaving every other line
byte-identical. The three output slots are presented as three groups of five rows, of which only the
current mode's is rendered — switching `OUTPUT_MODE` swaps delay and ratios together, and a save submits
a patch holding only the current slot's changes (plus whatever else was actually edited this time), so
saving right after a mode switch leaves the other two slots' ten VARs byte-identical. Slot edits left
behind by a mode switch are announced at the switch and are not submitted. The delay rows are editable
like any other value — they are the same VARs the firmware's calibration writes back into
(`HID_L_EST`/`PAD_L_EST`/`P5G_L_EST`), so a hand-typed delay and a calibrated one are one fact; the run
page's delay card names the slot in play, and the hot-param push takes its ratio keys from the running
instance's mode (a save into another slot is a script change that takes effect at the next start).

**Collection options** (enabled with `-o`, otherwise pure aimbot; the three sources are the `-e` list,
each also a hot switch):

```
-o output dir (auto-creates fire/ det/ auto/)  -e enabled sources fire,det,auto (default all)
-F fire interval ms (default 300)  -A timed interval s (default 10)  -C cooldown ms (default 500)
-q JPEG quality (default 95)
```

**Calibration**: aim at a static background with texture and take both hands off the controls, then hold
both side keys for 5 s (pad/p5g: L3+R3 for 5 s, or the panel's 「开始标定」 button = hot param
`padcalib=1`). Start = draw a cross (also the preparation window: the operator needs a moment to let go);
the round then drives the excitation, measures, and answers **nod = success / shake = failure**. With
`-S` the **delay alone** is written back into the script under the current output mode's VAR —
`HID_L_EST` (hid) / `PAD_L_EST` (pad) / `P5G_L_EST` (p5g), three independent slots (each mode's loop is
its own physical quantity, and p5g's includes the dongle's signing round trip); a failed round writes
nothing (no fabricated number) and says why in the log. The speed ratios are manual entries the firmware
never writes. All three output modes run the same engine (`io/calib_run.cpp`) — the gamepad pair shares
the excitation plan, the hid path has its own — so all are calibrated the same way; take the hands off
during the round because the measurement is of the screen's response to a program-injected motion (a
hand on the stick/mouse adds motion that has nothing to do with the commanded edge).

**Pad mode** (`-M pad`): the physical Xbox-layout gamepad passes through 1:1 (buttons, sticks, analog
triggers **with no threshold on the way out**); the aim trigger is RT ≥ `-T` and LT ≥ `-T` (one threshold
in % of full scale, shared by both — default 6 % = the measured trigger flat 15/255 rounded up, hot param
`padthr`), feeding the same `-k` fire/ads/both semantics as hid. The control law's desired velocity
(px/ms) is injected on the right stick **per axis** by the linear conversion `d = v·1000/A_eff` (`d` =
deflection fraction, `A_eff` = that axis's effective full-deflection screen speed =
`gain_pad_eff(spd_axis(ads, axis))`, see `core/state.h`), and the stick deflection is `d·32767`. The
injected deflection is merged with the human stick and radially clamped to the full-scale circle
(measured: the device's own travel is a circle — single axes reach ±32767, the diagonal pairs sit at
~0.71 full, and no logged sample exceeded |(x,y)| ≈ 33074 = 32767×1.009; the injection vector uses the
same geometry so the law's demanded direction is never rewritten by clamping, and the ledger books the
post-clamp value). The effective speed cap is `min(-x, A_eff/1000)` px/ms per axis (full deflection is
that axis's physical limit). A stick ledger records Σ(deflection·tick-ms) of what the game receives —
the pad counterpart of the `g_counts` invariant — and the estimator/law own-motion compensation source
is routed per mode (`own_motion_ledger`: hid = `g_counts`, pad = the stick ledger) together with its
ledger→pixel factor (`own_motion_scale`: hid = the per-axis effective sensitivity in px/count, pad =
`A_eff/(32767·1000)` px per deflection·ms; the axes must be separate or Y is biased systematically,
since the ledger unit is a per-axis deflection). Both the injection and both consumers take their base
from `gain_pad_eff`, so the ratio lands in the same effective gain everywhere — see the ratio-scale
paragraph above for why that placement is the design and not an implementation detail. The merged logical
state is published every tick into the `g_pad_publish` latest-slot (contract in `io/pad_output.h`) — the
output backend polls it and must not rewrite the sticks (the ledger already accounts what the game
receives). Disconnect/sleep self-heals: keys are cleared and the device is reopened on a 1 s retry cycle,
non-blocking at startup.

**The 8-bit→16-bit input mapping** (`io/pad_input`, the rule the whole gamepad channel rests on): the log
is 16-bit, while the measured G7 Pro reports 8-bit unsigned sticks (`0..255`, rest `128`). A device that
already reports a signed centred range passes through unchanged (its own ±32767 domain *is* the logical
domain, no table); an unsigned range is expanded by **uniform steps with the overflow absorbed by the
endpoint** — midpoint code `c = mn + (mx−mn+1)/2` (8-bit: `0x80 = 128`) → `0`, step
`S = floor(32767/(mx−c))` (8-bit: `floor(32767/127) = 258`), `out[c+k] = min(+S·k, +32767)` for
`k = 1..mx−c` and `out[c−k] = max(−S·k, −32767)` for `k = 1..c−mn`. The 8-bit family is served at runtime
by a **compile-time 256-entry table** built from that rule (`PAD_AXIS8_TABLE`), constructed so that all
255 physical levels are spread evenly over ±32767: 254 of the 255 adjacent steps are 258 and the one
short step (1) sits at the very bottom, where the deepest level `128×258 = 33024` would exceed the int16
range and is clamped to `−32767`. The step 258 rather than 257 is the whole point of the shape:
`floor(32767/127) = 258` is the largest integer step that keeps all 127 positive levels inside ±32767,
while a step of 257 would leave the highest level `32767 − 257·127 = 128` counts ≈ 0.4 % of full scale
short of full deflection, and games commonly read *full* deflection to decide sprint/max-turn, so a level
short costs a whole state; 258 misses by 1 count instead. The price is that the overflow must land
somewhere, and it lands in the deepest level because a game saturates on the deep side anyway. Properties
the unit test pins with an independently written golden table: every one of the 256 codes maps to a
distinct value, the midpoint is exactly 0 (`out[128] = 0`), the top is `out[255] = +32766`, the bottom is
`out[0] = −32767`, the map is monotone, and the step histogram is exactly `{258: 254, 1: 1}`. The naive
geometric midpoint `(mn+mx)/2 = 127.5` would instead report rest as +129 counts ≈ 0.4 % of full scale — a
standing bias on the human channel. No dead zone is added (the game owns its) and the device-declared
flat/fuzz is not applied. Measured and *not* compensated: the G7 Pro's own Y/RZ rest values are 124/125
and 126/128, i.e. the device sits 3–4 counts (≈3 % of full scale) off the nominal neutral — that is a
property of the device, this library does not correct it (the game's dead zone absorbs it), and if it
ever should be corrected one `absinfo` centre subtraction would do it (no per-device median capture).
Keeping the channel 16-bit is also what makes a small aim command meaningful: a 0.5 %-of-full-scale
command is 164 counts there (one count = 0.003 % of full scale) against 1.275 counts in an 8-bit domain
(one count = 0.39 %), i.e. the latter quantises the command by ≈22 %.

**Pad output** (`io/pad_xinput`): the pad mode's USB side is the emulated wired Xbox 360 pad — the host's
own XInput stack sees a device whose buttons/sticks/triggers are the merged logical state. Bytes and their
provenance are the device definition in `io/pad_xinput.cpp`; the wire's Y is up-positive while
`PadLogical` is up-negative, so the two Y axes are negated at the encoder (the unit test pins both the
assembly and the convention). The **terminal refresh rate** is `enumeration speed × endpoint bInterval`
(USB 2.0 §9.6.6), and the shipped pair is **high speed + `bInterval=4`** = 1 ms = 1000 Hz, with the device
qualifier a high-speed device must answer (USB 2.0 §9.6.2). The serial number is derived per machine
(FNV-1a-64 of `/etc/machine-id` → 12 uppercase hex digits, falling back to the dbus machine id then the
hostname) — the host derives its instance id from it, so a public constant would collide across units and
expose a device fingerprint; the derivation excludes the descriptor bytes because a definition change does
not need a new instance (the host re-reads descriptors on every arrival).

**P5 output** (`io/pad_p5g`): the p5g mode's USB side, for the PS5. The board enumerates as the P5 General
dongle itself (0x2B81/0x0101 — hardware-verified byte-identical to the real dongle in device identity,
configuration, endpoints, report descriptor and the 0x03 feature reply) while the **real dongle** rides a
host port as the signing co-processor: every merged 64-byte input report is written to the dongle's
interrupt OUT endpoint and only the dongle's interrupt IN return (hash and auth_seq_number filled by it)
goes to the PS5, so each report on the wire is authentically signed; the PS5's challenge/response
handshake travels the feature-report control transfers (0xF0 → dongle, 0xF1/0xF2 ← dongle) through the
reference state machine's dispatch rules, and starts only on the first physical-pad input (PS press). Idle
is silent on the wire (change-driven + 4 repeats, the reference's rule). Bring-up probe:
`sudo python3 scripts/test/p5g_dongle_probe.py` dumps the dongle's own descriptors, exercises the three
feature transfers and times the OUT→IN round trip.

**Report rate (a conclusion, not an open item).** The output rate is bounded by the real dongle's signing
round trip, not by anything in this repository's control chain, and that bound is acceptable by
construction:

- **The bound is a property of the dongle.** The dongle answers 1:1 and never pushes spontaneously, so a
  continuously-updated stream is serialized by the round trip; the probe's 8-submission timing gives the
  mean latency and hence the implied continuous-input ceiling, and that one measurement is the standing
  bound (`[PAD-USB]` is not an alternative instrument here: a change-driven flow reopens a >100 ms gap on
  its own cadence, so the 60 s window it needs may never complete).
- **It does not bound the control law.** The loop is closed through the camera: the crosshair position
  that the law acts on is sensed at the frame rate, so the pad update rate only has to sit well above the
  frame rate — nothing the law computes is sampled from the pad's report cadence. The signing round trip
  is a pure transport delay inside the loop, and a constant delay is exactly the quantity calibration
  measures (p5g's `P5G_L_EST`, one round, which in that mode includes the signature hop), so it is
  compensated rather than fought. Chasing a higher wire rate would therefore buy no control performance:
  it would shorten a delay the loop already identifies and cancel.
- **Consequence for the pad/p5g update path.** The per-tick submission into the session's latest-report
  slot is overwritten rather than queued (the same latest-slot semantics as every other device here), so
  a producer faster than the signing pipeline coalesces instead of accumulating a backlog; the pending
  watchdog (500 ms, the reference firmware's own dongle budget) bounds one stalled round trip and the next
  submitted state supersedes it.

**Bit width (three-way reconciliation)**: the cloned report descriptor declares **six 8-bit absolute
axes** (Usage X/Y/Z/Rz/Rx/Ry, logical 0–255, `Report Size 8 × Report Count 6` at descriptor offsets 25/27
→ bytes 1–6), the reference firmware keeps a **16-bit internal state** and right-shifts it by 8 into that
field (`P5GeneralDriver.cpp:156`), and `docs/p5general/` §4.1 transcribes both — so the wire is 8-bit and
the local 16-bit domain must be folded back into it exactly once. The reference's own fold is exact
**because its inbound map is `v×257`** (`map(v, 0..255, 0..65535)`, whose `>>8` inverts it for every
code) — but this library's inbound map is the step-258 table (`io/pad_input`), for which `>>8` and
`(v+32768)>>8` are **not** the identity: 127 of the 256 codes (all of 1..127, the whole negative half)
come back one step short, i.e. the human channel would be silently scaled down. The encoder therefore
uses the exact inverse of that table, `wire = clamp(floor(v/258) + 128, 0, 255)`, which reads as
"arithmetic shift by one wire step (258 logical counts)" and is the identity on all 256 codes (unit test,
code by code, with the rejected form's 127 failures counted beside it). Because every code's logical value
is a multiple of 258, `floor((human + inject)/258) = human/258 + floor(inject/258)`: the wire byte is
literally **the human's original code plus the injection's own 16-bit amount in whole wire steps** — the
human channel passes through unenlarged, only the aimbot's contribution is computed in 16 bits and folded
in, which is the landing rule the wire format requires. Rounding is floor (toward −∞, the direction an
arithmetic shift takes): an injection of +257 logical counts is still 0 wire counts while −257 already
reads −1, a one-sided half-step at the boundary that is reported rather than rounded away (it is 1/255 of
the axis's range). Two axes are left with no negation — the wire's stick Y is up-negative, the same
convention as `PadLogical` (unlike XInput). The class-request segment of ep0 routes to this device's hook
(see `usbraw`): SET_REPORT 0xF0's data stage is read out and forwarded, GET_REPORT 0x03 answers the 48-byte
static definition, GET_REPORT 0xF1/0xF2 answer the auth buffer, unknown feature IDs STALL.

Note: structural parameters (PM/ζ/FF_GAIN_VAL/FF_I_GATE/over-compensation and the â-channel constants) are
header constants in `src/core/control.h` — see "Tuning".

## Architecture

### Capture and inference (platform side)

The chain is `io/hdmi_in` → `io/rga_pp` → `io/npu_axcl` → `core/detect`, orchestrated by `io/capture`.
Four properties of it are design requirements rather than implementation choices:

- **The format is the signal's, not ours.** The receiver's driver accepts only the four formats it
  currently carries and refuses `S_FMT` for anything else, so the layer reads `G_FMT` and adapts; the
  stride and `sizeimage` are likewise taken from the driver (its rule is `bpl = ALIGN(width × bpp/8, 64)`,
  `sizeimage = bpl × height`, which reproduces the measured 2560×1440 BGR3 frame exactly at 11059200
  bytes and matches the 640×480 and 1920×1080 modes too), and the same one rule makes the RGA-required
  destination size equal the driver's `sizeimage` for all four formats.
- **The payload is not complete when `DQBUF` returns** (the `low_latency` switch moves completion from
  `dma_idle` to `line_flag`), so the dma-fence on the buffer is the completion credential and the frame is
  gated on it; without that gate anything that measures displacement within a frame (calibration's phase
  correlation included) would read a half-written picture as real motion. The `low_latency` switch itself
  is written by the layer before `STREAMON` and read back — the driver reads it once, at stream start, so
  the only place that can guarantee the order is the code calling `STREAMON`.
- **Newest-frame delivery.** A consumer slower than the signal would otherwise fall behind monotonically
  and act on a picture that is minutes old (measured: 16.2 ms frame age with newest-frame delivery against
  91.2 ms in queue order, under a deliberately slow consumer). The queue exists only so the driver never
  runs out of buffers — its own drop path discards the frame and does not resend.
- **A lost lock is a stream that stopped, and only a rebuild restores it.** The receiver loses TMDS lock
  when the source changes mode, the driver stops the stream by itself, and re-locking does **not** reattach
  it; the symptom is only a poll timeout. The layer separates "signal gone" (detected within one poll
  slice, up to 200 ms, by the receiver's lock query) from "stream stalled" (the whole poll budget with the
  lock still held, or a fence-timeout streak) and rebuilds in both cases — `STREAMOFF` (tolerated) → unmap
  → close the exported dmabufs → `REQBUFS(0)` → close → reopen → bounded wait for the lock → read `G_FMT`
  → rebuild and queue → `STREAMON`. The order of the last two matters: buffer sizes come from the
  **post-lock** format, and a mode change alters both resolution and frame rate. A failed rebuild leaves
  the device closed and retryable, so "source not powered yet" and "device broken" behave identically —
  wait, and never take the process down.

The coordinate domain is one: the canonical window is the centre 1:1 crop with side
`W = max(CAP_SIZE, model side)`. A model input smaller than the window is a second centre crop of the
window, whose only conversion back into the window domain is the translation `(W − model_side)/2`. The law,
the FOV gate and the calibration all live in that window — and **the crop does not scale**, which is what
keeps "screen pixel" one unit through the whole chain (`spd`, the FOV radius and the calibrated delay all
mean the same thing at every stage).

The **model contract** is read from the runtime, not assumed: input U8 NHWC RGB `[1,S,S,3]` (the converted
models carry their own dequantise/normalise/transpose, so the host feeds raw RGB bytes), and only outputs
whose layout parses are staged for D2H. A self-converted model whose output tensor carries coordinates and
confidences under one quantisation gives the confidence a resolution equal to the tensor's codeword length
— `model_probe` measures and prints both that codeword and the score channel's range for every kept output,
and the conversion-side fix is to split the head into one tensor per range. Detection numerics belong in
`core/detect`, which takes bare `float` tensors and knows no backend.

### State estimation

| State | Method | Source | Runtime |
|---|---|---|---|
| Position/velocity | alpha-beta (gains normalized by measured dt: α=PRED_ALPHA0·dt/DT0, β=PRED_BETA0·dt/DT0; prediction step subtracts own control action) | first detection | every frame |
| Effective sensitivity | **not calibrated**: the pull-speed ratios (four manual entries in the current output mode's slot, one per axis per fire state) divide that mode's baseline — `s_hid_now` = base·100/ratio per axis (hid), `gain_pad_eff` the same for the pad's full-deflection screen speed | — | user dials |
| Delay L | the round's three readings (sub-frame-exact tail sum as the primary, two frame-quantized edges), the only calibrated quantity | one calibration round per output mode | constant |

### Control law (ff_pi_acc, `src/core/control.cpp`)

```
Predictor (Smith, dt-normalized): α=min(.9, PRED_ALPHA0·dt/DT0), β=min(.6, PRED_BETA0·dt/DT0)
  Lc = L̂·PRED_L_COMP                                   // over-compensation; favors the under-compensated side (the dangerous one)
  ε = â·T·(α/β − ½),  W = age+Lc                        // α-β structural velocity lag on accelerating targets
  ê = f + (v̂+ε)·W + ½â·W² − s_eff·Σcounts(in flight)  // delay-removed error (s_eff per axis)
Convergence bandwidth: wn = (90°−PM)π/180 / L̂   (PM=50°, no hand tuning, auto-scales with L)
  Kp = 2ζ·wn, Ki = wn²   (ζ=1 critical damping, no overshoot)
  gate = FF_I_GATE/(FF_I_GATE+|ê|)                     // settled-region gate / I distance decay
  Direction-contradiction CUSUM (per axis, σ-normalized, σ online-estimated):
    S = max(0, S + clip(∓sign(v̂)·in/σ, 0, C) − K);  alarm S > H → reset that axis v̂=0 (position kept)
  Acceleration channel â = ȳ·β/T²                      // innovation-mean inversion (exact at any framerate)
    ȳ = gated EMA of the cleaned innovation             // three gates: rebuild suppression (after CUSUM
    floor = ACC_SNR·σ_noise·√(ρ/(2−ρ));  |ȳ| ≤ floor → â = 0   // reset/jump), own-acceleration activity gate,
  v = clamp(Kp·ê + Ki·∫err·gate + FF_GAIN_VAL·gate·gap_scale·(v̂+ε), ±vmax)   // significance floor
    gap_scale = 1 − clamp((age−frame_dt)/L̂, 0, 1)       // detection gap: withdraw the open-loop term on the L timescale
Quantization: rem += v·h/s_eff (per axis); counts = clamp(trunc(rem), ±120); rem −= counts
```

Without sustained real acceleration the three gates keep â ≡ 0 and the command stream is identical to plain
ff_pi (bit-exact in arena).

The **P term** `Kp·ê` is the fast channel: flicks and instant corrections. The **I term** `Ki·∫err` is the
slow channel: it removes the steady-state trail behind constant-velocity targets; the integrator is a
low-pass, so zero-mean periodic disturbances like recoil cannot accumulate → rejected as a side effect.
**No D term**: D amplifies high frequencies and would feed recoil noise back into the commands.

**Direction-contradiction CUSUM → velocity reset (归零重拉)**: every large overshoot on moving targets
traces to one root — the target model breaks (stop/ADAD reversal) and v̂ becomes a ghost that simultaneously
pushes FF the wrong way AND masks the error in the Smith prediction (the loop can't see its own trail →
mushy pull-back). When the CUSUM (Page sequential change test, σ-normalized, σ online-estimated — **no
absolute-px constants**; K/C/H are σ multiples so the gate auto-widens with device noise) detects
innovation sustained against v̂, that axis's velocity is reset to zero while the position estimate is kept:
the loop re-runs the step response (the best-tuned behavior: settle 277ms / 3.1px) with no ghost in the
projection (P sees the full true error → sharp pull-back) and FF rebuilding from zero in the correct
direction (no wrong-way push, no re-engagement kick). Only contradiction-direction innovation accumulates,
so the chase after a reset cannot re-trigger (innovation then agrees with the rebuilding v̂); the per-frame
increment cap (3σ) rejects single-frame kicks (recoil).

**No hand tuning inside the law & anti-windup**: the bandwidth `wn` depends only on the calibrated `L`
(tracking speed is recovered by the feedforward; PM=50 is the fastest design point the mismatch band
accepts — L20–70 and s0.7–1.3 outright, with the L80 corner settling on the 3 px edge and no divergence;
test-suite-chosen, not feel-chosen). Anti-windup = conditional integration (freeze the integrator when the
output is saturated and the error still pushes toward saturation) + integrator clamp `±FF_I_FRAC·vmax/Ki`,
preventing windup overshoot on long flicks.

### Calibration

One measurement method, one state machine, one fit (`io/calib_run.cpp`), shared by all three output modes;
a mode supplies only its excitation plan (the hid one, or the gamepad one that `pad` and `p5g` share), its
injection units and the delay VAR it writes. **The deliverable is the loop delay `L` alone** — speed is
never calibrated (the per-game feel is the four manual `spd` ratios). The engine's three readings produce the
**physical** leg of it; the write-back adds the inference leg the round skips, in one place, so the number the
script holds is the whole loop (see "Triggers, feedback, write-back" below).

**Observation model.** The command edge is at `t₀`; the picture follows it delayed by `L`: the frame at `tₖ`
shows the world's displacement over `[tₖ−dt−L, tₖ−L]`. Every reading below is "the distance between the
command edge and the picture edge" on that same observation stream, and the loop delay cancels inside each
segment's slope — so a segment's measured travel overshooting its target by `v·L` is harmless, and the
method does not depend on the sampling rate.

**Excitation shape (designed for the delay, not for a speed curve).** Per axis: quiet → hold `+d` until the
travel is there → stop → a 300 ms quiet pause → repeat with the opposite sign, so the picture returns to
where it started. The amplitude is derived from a **target screen speed `v*` under three constraints**:

1. **segment span ≥ 6 frames at the measured sampling rate**: the segment lasts `T = A/v*`, so
   `v* ≤ A/(6·dt)`. Sized at the slowest assumed rate (60 fps) so both 60 and 120 fps satisfy it, this gives
   `v*[H] = 150px/100ms = 1.5 px/ms` and `v*[Y] = 100px/100ms = 1.0 px/ms` (`A` = the travel target).
   Measured sampling rate and the realised span are logged per round.
2. **per-frame displacement inside the correlation range**: `v*·dt ≤ 106 px` = 12 700 px/s at 120 fps
   against a design 12.5 px/frame — an 8.5× margin, there only so a game much faster than assumed turns
   into a discarded segment rather than a wrong number.
3. **tail `v·L` far above the noise**: the tail reading's time resolution is `σ√n/v`, which must stay under
   the edge readings' own quantization `dt/2` → `v ≥ 2σ√n/dt` ≈ 0.11 px/ms at the measured σ (0.03–0.1
   px/frame) — the design value is 13× that.

Injecting it: hid commands `r = v*/s_hid_now(ads, axis)` counts/ms (the spd scale's effective sensitivity —
the single conversion base of this mode) quantized per tick with a running remainder so the mean rate is
exact; pad commands a deflection `d = clamp(v*·1000/gain_pad_eff(spd_axis(ads,axis)), 0.30, 1)` — 1 = full
deflection (the physical stop), 0.30 = the measured dead-zone floor (10 % deflection barely moves the
picture). **That clamp is also the measurable ratio band**: `d = spd/200` at the default gain, so only
`spd ∈ [60, 200]` (= `[gain/50, gain/15]`) lets the design `v*` land exactly; below 60 the 0.30 floor
holds, the realised screen speed becomes `90000/spd` px/s = `750/spd` px/frame, and every segment is
discarded — by the 106 px range gate for `spd ≲ 7`, by the "measurement window ≥ one frame" gate for
`spd ≲ 10` (120 fps) / `≲ 20` (60 fps), since the 25 %→75 % secant shrinks to `0.83·spd` ms against a frame
of 8.3/16.7 ms. The failure is honest (the segment is dropped, no number is invented) and it costs nothing
operationally, because calibration and `spd` are independent quantities: **dial `spd` into 60–200,
calibrate `L`, dial it back** — `L` is a property of the loop, not of the ratio (`core/state.h`'s 5..2000
is `spd`'s own usable band, not this excitation's domain). Axis coverage: hid excites both axes (per-axis
mouse smoothing differs; the two axes' results are reported side by side), pad only the horizontal one (the
vertical channel is polluted by pitch clamping and rotational aim assist — measured: during a round the
other axis is continuously pulled).

**Readings (three, independent).** Each segment yields a start edge and a stop edge; each pause yields the
tail:
- **Tail sum (primary, sub-frame exact):** after the stop command the picture still travels `v·L`, so the
  pause's displacement sum is `v·(t₁−t_first+dt_first+L)` → `L = Σ/v + (t_first−t₁) − dt_first`. The sum
  telescopes between the first and last *world* instants, so dropped frames change nothing. `v` is the
  segment's **mid-secant** (the 25 %→75 % crossings of the target) — noise at the onset cannot leak into it,
  which matters because the reading is first-order sensitive to `v`.
- **Start edge:** the first sample whose accumulated travel leaves the noise envelope (`K·σ√n`, not a fixed
  `3σ`: the accumulation is a random walk under noise, so a fixed gate is crossed within a few frames and
  the edge lands 10–50 ms early). `L = t_first_moving − t₀ − dt/2`.
- **Stop edge:** the last sample still above `max(3σ, 0.5 px)`. `L = t_last_moving − t₁ − dt/2`.

Both edges use the same mid-bracket rule (±dt/2, symmetric) and are quantized to the frame grid. The **stop
edge is reported, not gated**: once the game's smoothing rounds the command edge, that reading walks with
`τ·ln(v·dt/threshold)` (measured: 47 ms late at τ = 15 ms, while the start edge is 4 ms late) — it is the
field's window into the response's shape. The consistency gate therefore pairs the tail with the **start
edge** (a pure time difference, gain- and threshold-independent).

**Pause length and the `L` bound are one decision.** The pause must hold (a) the tail, (b) a genuinely
static reference window for σ, (c) the next segment's onset margin. So the static window starts at
`L_MAX + 2·dt_60 = 160 ms` and lasts 140 ms, and the pause is `160+140 = 300 ms`. The same 160 ms is the
self-check: a tail reading above it means the pause no longer contains the tail (a truncated tail saturates
exactly at the pause length) → the round fails with that reason instead of reporting a smaller number.
`L_MAX = 120 ms` = 7 frames at 60 fps (4 game-side input→display + 3 capture/inference/tick) — a
measurement outside `[0, 120]` fails rather than being clamped. The gate is applied to the **physical**
reading, which is what a truncated tail would corrupt; the bound's own derivation is the *whole* loop, so the
written total (physical + inference leg) is the quantity that derivation is about, and the CLI's `-l` clamp,
`[L_MIN, L_MAX]`, is applied to that same total.

**Gates** (each with its source; the tail-vs-edge difference and every family's median/MAD are printed
whether or not a flag is set): travel reached (to-target stop; a timeout is "unmeasurable" and reports the
speed upper bound 150px/2000ms = 75 px/s), per-frame displacement inside the correlation range (half the
block's screen-domain width = 106 px), block spread as the per-segment **median** (the frame maximum is
logged only — one ambiguous frame must not discard a segment), response above the texture floor (median
correlation peak ≥ 0.05 = 5× the block inclusion gate), a measurement window ≥ one frame, the tail not
truncated (≤ 160 ms), per-family **MAD ≤ one measured sampling interval** (the readings' own quantization;
more means they are not repeats of one physical measurement), tail-vs-start-edge agreement within 3 combined
standard errors + one frame + 30 % of `L` (the last two are the edge's quantization and the law's proven
mismatch band), a family needs **≥ 5 readings** to be aggregated at all, and the σ pool needs **≥ 20 static
samples per axis** (median + MAD's minimum sample size; a family is that mode's readings pooled — 8 for
hid's two axes, 6 for pad's one — and the plan gives 4 pauses per axis to feed the σ pool), `L` inside its
physical band, and **at least one segment with measured motion** (otherwise the whole round fails: "screen
not responding"). Aggregation is median + MAD per reading family; the written value is the tail family's
median (the stop-edge family is the fallback when no tail survives, and is announced). For hid the two
axes' tail medians are printed side by side as a diagnostic and the written value is the **whole-round**
median — there is no per-axis agreement test: each axis carries only 4 tail readings (fewer than median +
MAD's minimum sample size), their scatter is already what the family's MAD gate covers (two axes genuinely
apart blow that gate first and fail the round with both medians and the dispersion in the log), and both
branches of such a test would write the same number, which is why the number is not gated on it.

**Sampling side.** 640×640 centre crop → grayscale → INTER_AREA to the 320 half-resolution domain → 3×3
blocks (≈106 correlation px) → per block, a **1-D projection phase correlation along the excitation axis**.
Both that and the 2-D block correlation are implemented and measured (same synthetic injections, real
signal texture): 0.90 vs 5.19 ms/frame (11 % vs 62 % of the 120 fps budget), sub-pixel error ±0.01 vs
−0.04…−0.15 screen px, peak at a 60 px shift 0.54 vs 0.31, identical HUD rejection, cross-axis leakage
−0.05 vs −0.04 px — the projection wins on all three counts, and the 320 domain (rather than 1:1) is kept
because the domain only buys sampling rate. Static content is rejected per frame *before* any median is
taken: a game HUD is still on screen, so its blocks report "shift ≈ 0 with a high correlation peak" and a
HUD majority collapses the plain block median to 0 at real displacements (measured: 6/9 blocks static, true
displacement 90 px → plain median 0.00, while the cluster median reads 89.9) — blocks below half the
largest block shift are therefore dropped first. Reliable per-frame shift = half the block width in the
screen domain = 106 px (the circular correlation's peak is unique only below it; measured exact at 52
domain px). A reported pixel is a *screen* pixel (×2 scale). The cost is a fraction of the capture thread's
frame budget and needs no AI detection at all; during a round the inference path is skipped entirely (a
round's measured sampling rate, capture rate, no-sample fraction and per-frame sampling cost are printed by
that round and asserted by `scripts/test/uinput_calib_test.py`).

**Triggers, feedback, write-back.** hid = both side keys held 5 s; pad/p5g = L3+R3 held 5 s or `padcalib=1`
(consumed once — a request arriving mid-round is logged and dropped, never re-entrant). The round owns the
injection channel (hid: the report's displacement bytes; pad: `pad_excite`, which centres the human sticks
and triggers and keeps the buttons so L3/R3 still reach the game) and stands the law down. Success writes
only the current output mode's delay VAR (`HID_L_EST`/`PAD_L_EST`/`P5G_L_EST`) atomically, and **the value it
writes is the complete loop delay**: `L_written = L_physical + inference_average`, where `L_physical` is what
this engine's three readings measure (they are all anchored on frame timestamps) and the inference leg
(`pack + H2D + exec + D2H + decode` — the segment the `[AI FPS]` line already reports) is accumulated by the
capture thread from ordinary frames. The two legs the round **does** pay — waiting for a frame's payload and
the RGA crop — are deliberately *not* added: the calibration round waits for the same frames and crops the
same 640 window itself, so those are shared legs already inside every reading, and adding them would count
the same delay twice. The round's log carries both numbers and the total: the physical `L`, the averaged
inference leg with the frame count it was averaged over, and the written sum; a cold start (no inference
frame has run yet in this process) writes the physical value alone and says so — no number is ever invented.
The leg is a measured, load-dependent quantity rather than a constant, which is exactly why it is averaged at
write-back time: on this board with the shipped 320-px 4-class model the `[AI FPS]` line reads 2.39 ms mean
over 7187 frames in a quiet 60 s window and 3.66 ms mean over 6767 frames while another NPU consumer shared
the card (`pack 0.05 H2D 0.76 exec 1.25 D2H 0.28 解码 0.05` against `0.05 / 1.42 / 1.27 / 0.87 / 0.05` ms) —
the two transfer segments, not the NPU's own execution, are what the contention moves.
The runtime's `l_est` is set to that same sum in the one place the composition happens (the capture thread),
so the value in the script and the value the law uses are one fact. The shift is small enough that the
evaluation groups hold at it: `arena.eval ff_pi_acc 52.3` gives matched 116.62, worst mismatch 115.51 and a
60/120 fps delta of 1.2% (against 114.66 / 125.12 / 1.9% at the 50 ms belief), `arena.integrate`'s wide band
(L20–80) and sensitivity band (s0.7–1.3) show no divergence at that belief, and `arena.fps_eval`'s totals
move within a few percent either way (clean mean overshoot 27.35 → 26.01 px) — the one cell that gets
visibly worse is the flaky `drop_p=0.12` airborne on-body fraction (78% → 70%), the price of the 4.4% lower
`wn` that a larger believed delay buys. `-a n` (pure pass-through) makes
calibration unreachable and resets a running round (the excitation is program-injected motion, exactly what
pass-through forbids). Unmeasurable outcomes are reported as such with their evidence in the log: no motion
at all, only noise (σ = 0.000 exactly = a frozen screen — the observation when the receiver carries a static
desktop), a truncated tail, or dispersion beyond one sampling interval. **A source loss voids the round**:
the correlation domain's "previous frame" and the sample history both straddle that gap (frame intervals
become seconds), so a rebuild clears both and the round fails honestly as "no samples"; a request that
arrives during the outage is consumed and answered as a failure — with no picture, any write-back could only
be a fabricated value.

## Invariants

1. **Gains are normalized by measured dt**; framerate changes don't change the feel.
2. **Never assume 1 count = 1 px**; everything is converted through the effective sensitivity (per axis, per
   fire state).
3. **`g_counts` records exactly the counts the game actually received** (mouse + aimbot + calibration);
   filter compensation and in-flight correction depend on it. Calibration does not read it (the measurement
   comes entirely from screen displacement).
4. **Jumps beyond `TRACK_JUMP_GATE` reset the filter**; no patch-style clamps.
5. Calibration sampling (phase correlation) **does not depend on AI detection**; the two couple only through
   `l_est`.
6. The calibration state machine is driven by that mode's 1 kHz tick (hid: the law tick in
   `core/control.cpp`; pad/p5g: the pad tick in `io/pad_output.cpp`) and lives in `io/calib_run.cpp` with one
   state instance per mode; the capture thread only responds to the three atomics
   `g_calib_collect`/`g_calib_request`/`g_calib_done` (`g_padcalib_request` is the panel's one-shot round
   request).
7. **Durations are wall-clock milliseconds** (`ms_to_ticks`, `core/state.h`): a tick count is never the
   source of truth for how long something lasts — the calibration trigger (5 s), the segment timeout
   (2000 ms), the pause (300 ms), the travel targets and the ledger histories are stated in milliseconds,
   and **every calibration reading is a ratio of measured timestamps and measured `dt`** (edge brackets,
   tail windows, the mid-secant denominator), so a lower sampling rate only coarsens the readings (visible
   in their MAD) and neither re-times nor re-scales the measurement. The excitation is a screen-speed
   profile converted to the mode's own injection unit (counts/ms for hid, a deflection fraction for pad)
   and quantized per tick, so the tick rate is a sampling-resolution choice, not a tuning knob.
8. **The capture rate is the signal's, not a parameter.** There is no frame-rate flag; the receiver's locked
   timing defines the frame length scale (`src_fps()`), and the only measurable rate is the detection rate
   on the `[AI FPS]` line.
9. **The output mode owns exactly one input channel and one UDC session**: hid reads the real mouse and
   never opens the gamepad, pad/p5g read the gamepad and never start the mouse session, and all three run
   the *same* control law with the same estimator and the same delay `L` (each mode family with its own
   calibrated value and its own write-back VAR). The per-mode difference is where the law's velocity index
   lands (counts vs stick deflection), the speed cap's second argument (none vs that axis's effective
   full-deflection speed) and the own-motion ledger's unit — all three are defined once, in `io/pad_output`
   and `core/state.h`, and are consumed by injection, in-flight compensation and the estimator's
   compensation from that single definition.
10. **p5g: the bytes on the PS5's wire are always the dongle's bytes** — the backend never sends an input
    report that did not come back from the real dongle (the hash field is the per-report auth data and only
    the dongle can fill it), and no report is produced at all while the dongle is absent. The 8-bit wire
    field is likewise an exact round trip of the human channel: the encoder is the exact inverse of
    `io/pad_input`'s 8→16 table, and the injection is folded in as whole wire steps, so passthrough is
    unenlarged and unclipped by the fold.

## Tuning

**The law has no hand-tuned gains; the speed scale is what the operator supplies.** After calibrating `L`,
`wn` scales with `L` automatically (PM=50° is the test suite's choice, ζ and the FF gain are
principle-derived), and the per-game speed is the current output mode's four pull-speed ratios — one per
axis, plus a second pair while ADS is held, one slot of five hand-editable values per mode. Those ratios are
not a tuned constant: they encode the game's own input sensitivity (hid: px/count; pad/p5g: px/s at full
deflection), which the firmware cannot observe. Their correct value puts the loop at its design point —
which is why the calibration log prints each excitation segment's measured screen speed beside the assumed
sensitivity, the exact value following from that by arithmetic. The law's proven mismatch envelope is ±30%
(arena `s0.7–1.3`), so a value past the game's true sensitivity is a deliberate gain overrun that spends
phase margin; the per-axis and per-ADS split is physical (vertical is commonly slower, ADS commonly lowers
sensitivity), not taste. The ratio is also **resolution-bound** — both flavours of sensitivity are pixel
quantities measured at the source resolution in play — so the shipped default carries the reference-to-
deployment shift of the resolution rule below: `75` at the 1440p source, not `100`.

### The resolution rule (the law's constants are pixels)

The law, the FOV gate and the calibration all live in the **captured frame's pixel domain**, so raising the
source resolution does not change any code constant — it changes the **physics of a pixel**. A pixel is not
an angle, and what physically happens on screen scales with

```
R = (pixels per degree of the new source) / (pixels per degree of the reference source)
```

which for the same field of view is just the width ratio. The **reference source is the 1080p working
point** (`f ≈ 960 px`, hFOV 90°) that every pixel-denominated derivation in this library is expressed at —
the `MAX_SPEED` argument, the two sensitivity baselines (`S_HID_BASE`, `GAIN_PAD_BASE`) and the default FOV
radius. The **deployment source is 2560×1440**, i.e. R = 1440/1080 = **4/3** against that reference. Three
quantities move, in two directions:

| Quantity | Where it lives | Scaling | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MAX_SPEED` (`-x`, px/s) | crosshair speed cap (`g_max_v`) | **× R** | the crosshair must still cover the same angular rate: the screen speed of a given world motion is proportional to the pixels per degree, and `f` (px) is proportional to the width |
| `FOV_RADIUS` (`-r`, px) | target-selection gate and integrator-start boundary | **× R** | the same angular engagement circle spans R× as many pixels |
| the four pull-speed ratios (`--spd`/`--ads-spd`) | effective sensitivity = baseline / (ratio/100) | **÷ R** | the ratio is the inverse of the sensitivity the firmware assumes: `s_eff = baseline/(ratio/100)`, and the count stream is `counts = v/s_eff`. The baselines are 1080p values, while the game's real sensitivity (px per count, px/s per full deflection) is R× *higher* at a source with R× more pixels per degree, so the assumed sensitivity must rise with it and the ratio — being its inverse — must fall |

Everything stated in time is untouched: `L` (ms) is a delay, not a length, so the calibration's result and
every gate expressed in milliseconds or in frames carry over unchanged. The canonical window `CAP_SIZE` is a
pixel count too and does not move — but note that at a higher source resolution the same 640-pixel window
covers a smaller angle, which is exactly why the two operator values above must be rescaled while the code
stays as it is.

**Worked example — a 1080p → 1440p source, R = 4/3.** The reference column is where the derivations were
made (the whole `MAX_SPEED` argument in the launcher template is expressed at that scale); the deployment
column is what this repository **ships**, in the launcher template, the panel's parameter defaults and the
firmware's interactive/CLI defaults alike:

| Value | at the 1080p reference | at 1440p (× or ÷ 4/3) — shipped |
|---|---|---|
| `MAX_SPEED` | 2000 px/s | **2667 px/s** |
| `FOV_RADIUS` | 150 px | **200 px** |
| any pull-speed ratio | e.g. 100 | **75** |
| `L` | the calibrated value | unchanged (a time) |
| `CAP_SIZE` | 640 px | unchanged (a pixel count) |

The direction is the part that is easy to get backwards: the ratios go **down** by R, not up. With the ratio
left at its 1080p value (100 where 75 is right) the firmware *over*-estimates how many counts the crosshair
needs: the assumed sensitivity `s_eff = baseline/(ratio/100)` is R× too **low**, so `counts = v/s_eff` for
the same desired screen velocity is R× too **many** and the crosshair over-pulls — far past its design
point, spending the phase margin the law's proven mismatch envelope (±30 %) leaves — and the operator's
instinct to "dial it up for a faster pull" would move it further still, since a larger ratio is precisely
the wrong direction. **未验证**: the scaling itself is the rule's arithmetic, not a board measurement; what
the calibration log's "measured screen speed beside the assumed sensitivity" confirms per game is the final
dial, and it is the operator's entry either way.

Structural parameters are header constants in `src/core/control.h` (law, filter and trigger constants),
`src/core/state.h` (system constants, the tick period and the ratio scale's base constants) and
`src/io/calib_run.h` (calibration plan, gate and duration constants, each with its derivation in that file's
header) / `src/core/calib.h` (sampling geometry):

| Constant | Default | Meaning | On-device adjustment |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FF_PM_DEG` | 50 | Phase margin (wn=(90−PM)π/180/L) | Mismatch oscillation → raise (lower wn: stabler, slower); 50 = the fastest point the delay band accepts (L20–70 outright, L80 on the 3 px edge) |
| `FF_ZETA` | 1.0 | Convergence damping ratio (critical) | Overshoot → raise; too slow → lower (<0.7 overshoots) |
| `FF_GAIN_VAL` | 1.0 | Velocity feedforward gain (type-2 exact value) | Fixed by principle; normally don't touch |
| `FF_I_GATE` | 8.0 | Settled-region gate / I distance-decay scale / withdrawal-weight scale (px) | Tracking trail → raise; flick overshoot → lower |
| `FF_I_FRAC` | 1.0 | Integrator clamp (×vmax/Ki) | Windup overshoot → lower |
| `PRED_ALPHA0/BETA0` | 0.50/0.03 | Filter position/velocity gains @120fps | Model jitter → lower ALPHA0; **real device much noisier → lower BETA0 first** (FF noise goes through it; 0.03 = band-edge margin) |
| `PRED_L_COMP` | 1.10 | Smith over-compensation factor | Calibrated L too low (dangerous) → keep >1; too high → 1.0 |
| `TRACK_JUMP_GATE` | 100 px | Innovation above this resets the filter | Raise only if a real re-lock is being rejected mid-track |
| `TARGET_STALE_MS` | 200 ms | Target times out → aiming pauses | Raise on a very slow game (the last target keeps its old position for longer) |
| `FOV_RADIUS` | 150 px | Default FOV radius — target selection gate AND integrator-start boundary; runtime value overridable via `-r` and hot-param `fov` | Widen: farther targets enter the gate (multi-target grab risk); beyond the window's half-diagonal it is wasted. **Rescale with the source resolution (see the resolution rule)** |
| `CAP_SIZE` | 640 px | Canonical window side — the domain the law, the FOV gate and calibration live in | Only meaningful together with the model side: `W = max(CAP_SIZE, model side)`, and the crop does not scale |
| `NMS_IOU_THR` | 0.45 | NMS IoU gate | The YOLO export toolchain's default; class-wise, and aiming keeps the nearest in-FOV target |
| `S_HID_BASE` / `GAIN_PAD_BASE` / `SPD_*` | 1.0 / 3000 / 100 · [1,10000] | The ratio scale's baselines and clamp (see "Parameters") | The baselines decide how close a ratio's first guess is; the ratios are what gets dialled |

On-device workflow: ① calibrate L (L too low is the dangerous direction); the speed feel is the ratios,
dialled per game. ② If the real device's noise is far above arena's 0.5px: **lower `PRED_BETA0` first** —
don't rush to add filters (that becomes hidden control tuning). ③ Mismatch oscillation → raise `FF_PM_DEG`
(lower wn) or raise `FF_ZETA`. ④ After changing any estimator/compensation constant, rerun the wide-delay
sweep of `arena.integrate ff_pi_acc` and the FPS behavior test suite `arena.fps_eval ff_pi_acc` to confirm
no divergence and no event regression; the firmware must also pass `scripts/compile.sh`'s five unit tests on
the board.

## arena control-law simulation

`arena/` is a **neutral pure-Python simulator** for fair evaluation/comparison/tuning of control laws. All
control-law conclusions stand on its measurements. It is platform-independent — a Python 3 interpreter is
all it needs, nothing the board provides — so all control-law exploration happens on the development
mirror, and the winner is ported into the firmware control section (`src/core/control.cpp` with
`src/core/estimator.cpp`).

### Design principles (important)

- **arena simulates only "plant + sensor"; it contains no estimation/prediction/control logic.** Smith
  predictors, alpha-beta, Kalman, MPC internal models, etc. are implementation details of a law and don't
  belong in arena. Swapping laws = swapping one object; any method can be compared fairly.
- **Minimal interface** (`arena/laws/base.py`):
  - Observation arena→law: every control tick receives the latest frame `Observation(t, dx, dy, new)`.
    `dx,dy` = target−crosshair (px), reflecting the world at `t − L_true`, noise included; `new=False` means
    no new detection since the previous frame.
  - Input law→arena: `step(t, obs) -> (cx, cy)` integer counts. The law keeps its own detection and command
    history and does its own estimation/prediction/quantization.
- **Pure timestamp-driven**: sensing uses the real `L_true`; the `L` a law believes internally is its own
  business (`cfg.L`). Testing delay mismatch is just setting the two differently — arena supports it
  natively.
- **Observation cadence ≠ control cadence**: detections are published at framerate (120/60fps); the firmware
  control tick is 1kHz (`DEFAULT_FREQ`), modeled in arena at 500Hz (2ms) as the conservative time
  approximation — 1 arena tick ≈ 2 firmware ticks; the two cadences are modeled separately (~4 arena ticks
  per frame).
- **Faithful plant/sensor**: pure delay (a frame reflects the world at t−L; target and crosshair are both
  sampled at that moment), framerate/control rate, command quantization and clamping (±120 counts), optional
  detection noise, per-frame detection dropout (`drop_p`), near-instant crosshair response to commands
  (delay only on the observation side).
- **Self-test**: a conservative Smith+PI baseline law (`laws/reference.py`) with known behavior (stable
  convergence, visible ramp-up) validates the arena — if it fails to reproduce these behaviors, fix arena
  first. Currently passing.

**Why 2D screen space is the right arena (and not "3D")**: the whole sense-control loop lives in screen
pixels (capture → detect → dx,dy → law → counts → crosshair); the 3D game world is just one generator of
screen-space trajectories, and the law never sees the world. The FPS behavior library (`fps.py`) therefore
models the *screen-space shape* of 3D behaviors: jumps are parabolas on screen-y only (world-vertical motion
projects to screen-vertical, orthogonal to any strafe heading), strafe heading is a free angle, wall-bounce
is a full 2V velocity reversal, jump-landing is a hard y-velocity step. The only unmodeled 3D effect is
tan-projection nonlinearity (s varies by sec² across the screen): ~2.4% inside the ±150px FOV circle —
negligible; a 3D world+camera+projection Target subclass can be added later without touching core.

**Adding a new law**: create a file in `laws/`, subclass `Law`, `@register("name")`, implement
`reset(cfg)`/`step(t,obs)->(cx,cy)`, and add an import line in `laws/__init__.py`. See `arena/AUTHORING.md`.
**Adding a new scenario**: write a `Target` subclass + `Scenario` in `scenarios.py` and add it to
`standard_suite()` (all laws are then evaluated on the same scenario automatically).
**Adding a new metric**: add a function in `metrics.py`, aggregate in `runner.py`.

### Process tracing (`arena/trace.py`, debug-only)

Aggregate finals alone do not show where a law breaks; `trace.py` replays **one** law × **one** scenario and
shows where it breaks: per-tick CSV (`t/ex/ey/|e|/sent counts/new-frame/obs fields`), a compact terminal
summary (band-entry ladder 10/5/3/1px, `event_metrics` event windows, worst-1s window, tail-oscillation
verdict), event/auto window export, optional PNG. **Pure observation by construction** (law proxy;
core/runner untouched) — the three default test suites are bit-identical with or without it (verified by
diff). Optional law-side protocol: a law may implement `debug() -> dict[str, float]`; trace records it per
tick as `dbg_*` columns — field names/semantics belong to the law's own docstring, arena never interprets
them; `debug()` must be side-effect-free and is never called by eval/integrate/fps_eval. `laws/__init__.py`
auto-imports `_wip_*.py` experiment copies (register as `wip_<name>`) so parallel debugging never touches the
shared file; a broken WIP file is skipped with a stderr note, never blocks the real laws. Trace outputs live
in gitignored `arena/trace_out/`.

### Error attribution: where a law's error actually lives (`arena/diag.py`, debug-only)

Aggregate finals — including the FPS suite's headline `over = peak − median|e| over the 200 ms before the
event` — are **relative**. Once a law is already trailing for a long time before an event (the airborne phase
of a jump is the canonical case), `pre` is already large, so `over` stays small and the sustained trailing is
invisible in both `over` and the scenario-wide RMSE (diluted by the normal ground-phase tracking). Two
instruments close that hole:

- **`metrics.phase_metrics`** — scenarios declare sustained-phase windows (`Scenario.phases`; the jump /
  bhop / wall-bounce / dash / slide entries in `fps_suite` declare `air`/`dash`/`slide`) and report
  rmse/mean/p95/max plus `on_body` (|e| ≤ `metrics.body_px(dist_m)`, the torso half-width at the scenario's
  engagement distance). The band must scale with distance: a fixed band systematically understates hits up
  close (a 0.25 m half-width is 80 px at 3 m, 24 px at 10 m). `fps_eval` prints the phase table and an
  `[air]` aggregate. `Scenario.dist_m` also carries the **1/d projection scaling** used by the near-range
  jump entries: screen velocity and screen gravity both ∝ 1/d, so the same world jump at distance d is the
  10 m calibration times (10/d), with air time 2·v_z/g and hence arc apex ∝ 1/d.
- **`arena.diag`** — replays the *same* law with only its velocity state replaced by the true velocity at the
  observation's capture time `t−L_true`: the newest world state its information set could recover, i.e. the
  honest **causal** bound (using the truth at `t` would be peeking at future maneuvers). The pair of runs
  splits a scenario's error into the estimator-limited part (`est_share = 1 − oracle/law`) and the residual
  that delay, loop bandwidth and actuator saturation set.

Shipped law, matched L=50 / 120 fps / noise 0.5 / seeds 1–3:

| scenario / phase | law rmse | oracle rmse | est_share | on_body law → oracle |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| fps_jump_land_stop / air (10 m) | 18.90 | 7.02 | **63%** | 87% → 98% |
| fps_jump_5m / air | 38.02 | 15.61 | **59%** | 87% → 98% |
| fps_jump_3m / air | 68.26 | 39.41 | 42% | 80% → 89% |
| fps_wall_bounce / air | 30.80 | 15.65 | 49% | 68% → 90% |
| fps_bhop / air (3 legs) | 19.0–26.8 | 6.9–13.1 | 51–64% | 78–87% → 91–98% |
| maneuver / all | 19.00 | 10.29 | 46% | 79% → 95% |
| fps_dash / dash | 70.64 | 54.48 | **23%** | 16% → 16% |

The jump / bhop / bounce / maneuver family is **estimator-limited** (42–64% of the error is the α-β velocity
estimate; with a perfect one the on-body fraction reaches 89–98%). `fps_dash` is not — its burst
(4 × 0.4 = 1.6 px/ms) exceeds the 1.5 px/ms speed cap, so the crosshair is saturated and on-body stays at
16% even with a perfect velocity: a speed-cap problem is not a control-law problem, and no estimator work
fixes it. Raising the cap confirms the ordering — `arena.diag ff_pi_acc fps_dash --max-v 3` moves the oracle
from 54.5 to 35.4 px and on-body 16% → 43%, while the law itself barely moves (70.6 → 70.0, the estimator
cannot use the higher cap); the cap is that phase's first constraint and latency its second. The 3 m jump is
mixed, because the cap binds wherever |v_z| exceeds it — which is why its est_share falls to 42%.

At composite level the same substitution gives **matched 114.66 → 54.06 and worst mismatch 125.12 → 87.69**
(`arena.diag <law> --suite`): the mismatch band does *not* degrade, so the architecture tolerates a correct
velocity estimate. The estimator's remaining error is its own transient behaviour rather than noise — the β
leak turns a 40 px *position* step into a 0.14 px/ms ghost velocity that the feedforward projects over the
whole Smith horizon, and acquiring a velocity step takes ~1/β ≈ 278 ms, longer than a whole jump.

Constraints for any future estimator work (each measured, each a constraint rather than a preference):

- **A persistently faster gain is forbidden.** `PRED_BETA0` = 0.06 fails the band: at L_true = 30 the step
  response hunts and never enters the 3 px band (overshoot 24 px). β0 = 0.03 is pinned by loop gain and
  phase, not by innovation magnitude.
- **Robustifying the β input does not rescue it.** Clipping the velocity update's innovation (M-estimator
  style) buys a little on the mismatch band but costs matched and framerate consistency; the exact trade
  depends on where the clip is inserted, and no variant rescues β0 = 0.06, which fails the band exactly as
  before. The filter already clips the cleaned innovation at `ACC_SIG_CLIP_K`, so a second clip above that
  point is a no-op.
- **Only an evidence-gated one-shot correction can be both fast and safe.** A σ̂-normalized one-sided
  agreement CUSUM with a one-shot velocity catch-up holds the mismatch band with no divergence — the σ̂
  self-widening that makes the reset robust also blinds any σ-normalized gate under mismatch — but as tuned
  it loses on the composite, because detection dropouts and ordinary maneuvers produce the same sustained
  same-sign innovation signature as a takeoff. Its amplitude must be the alarm-window mean; taking the last
  frame's innovation alone is markedly worse on both the matched composite and accel tracking. The residual
  difficulty is structural rather than a matter of sizing: the window-mean innovation also carries the α-β
  *position* transient, so a catch-up dimensioned by it over-shoots and costs the airborne on-body fraction.
- **An attention/arming test cannot share the alarm's scale.** A deadband suppressing contradiction
  accumulation below a σ̂ multiple removes ~91% of all alarms and improves matched and framerate consistency,
  but it also removes the reset that flushes v̂ at real reversals (a clearly worse strafe-switch event
  overshoot at a 2σ̂ multiple), and it **self-blinds at the largest maneuvers**: at a 2V wall-bounce the
  discarded velocity is 0.45 px/ms — unambiguously real — yet classified as noise, because the bounce
  inflates σ̂ to ≈ 4.4 px so 2σ̂ ≈ 8.8 exceeds |v̂|·dt ≈ 3.8. Magnitude alone cannot be the discriminant
  either: over a full pass of the standard + FPS suites (baseline law, CUSUM resets that zero a velocity) the
  discarded velocity is a continuum running from the estimate's own velocity noise floor σ_v up to full
  target speed, so a magnitude threshold either keeps most false alarms or loses most real ones.
- **The â channel's rebuild suppression is not the airborne bottleneck.** A noise-level v̂ (≈0.008 px/ms)
  does arm the CUSUM and can hold the rebuild suppression for ~417 ms, but forcing that suppression off
  changes the 10 m airborne RMSE by 0.02 px (18.90 → 18.88) — the estimate itself is what trails, not the
  gate that hides it.
- **Velocity-estimate bandwidth is the airborne ceiling, and it is exactly the mismatch margin.** `arena.diag`
  attributes 42–64% of the airborne RMSE to the velocity state (causal bound 6.99–39.4 px against the law's
  18.90–68.26 px), and the entire gap is estimator bandwidth: `FFPiAccLaw(beta0=0.04)` — the first value that
  breaks the L20 corner, where the step response hunts and never settles (0.035 still passes, with a worse
  composite) — buys 5.6% (10 m airborne 18.90 → 17.85), `beta0=0.06` buys 17% (15.67) and hunts at
  L_true = 30, and `imm_pi`, the library's own fast estimator, reaches 10.92 px on the same scenario while
  failing the same band. Splitting the two places v̂ is consumed (the Smith assembly and the feedforward)
  does not separate the gain from the instability — a fast channel diverges through either path. The
  estimator a challenger must supply is therefore not a faster one but one whose error is *uncorrelated with
  the loop's own motion*: error that correlates with it closes a positive feedback whose gain rises with the
  mismatch, which is why every bandwidth increase is paid for in margin rather than being free tracking
  speed.
- **The â channel's gates are not where its headroom lies; its sensor is its own ceiling.** The significance
  floor forms the noise scale as the second moment of the clipped cleaned innovation minus ȳ², so the
  signal's own variance is booked as noise — during a 10 m jump the implied noise reads ≈1.3 px against a
  0.5 px detection noise — and the floor therefore rises with the very maneuver it is meant to detect. Each
  gate lifted alone is worth under a pixel; lifting the floor, the rebuild suppression and the CUSUM
  contradiction gate together still leaves most of the oracle gap, because ȳ is an EMA of a
  transient-dominated clipped innovation and carries only a fraction of the true acceleration. The
  contradiction gate is self-blocking by construction — the CUSUM declares a contradiction precisely because
  the α-β velocity lags, which is what the channel exists to correct — but it is load-bearing elsewhere:
  removing it trades airborne RMSE for FPS event overshoot and recovery. A challenger has to replace the
  sensor formulation, not the gates around it.

\* reseed_pi's fps-delta is a denominator effect: on the 60fps side step×2/const_vel/accel are bit-identical
to 120fps behavior and maneuver moves +0.5px; the improved 120fps composite shrinks the ratio. The FPS
behavior tests (`arena.fps_eval`) are the meaningful law-vs-law comparison.

### The shipped law (ff_pi_acc → `src/core/control.cpp`)

**Core constraint (low patch-smell / generalization first)**: reject parameters "tuned by trial that cannot
be explained from principle" (games change, and the tests don't run in-game). Therefore:

- **The convergence bandwidth `wn` is always derived from the calibrated delay `L`**:
  `wn = (90°−PM)·π/180 / L`, PM=50° (a dimensionless design choice — the fastest point the delay band
  accepts outright: L20–70 and s0.7–1.3, with the L80 corner settling on the 3 px edge and no divergence),
  auto-scaling with `L`; **no hardcoded tuned constants**. At L=50, wn≈0.01396 rad/ms.
- **The type-2 velocity feedforward `FF_GAIN_VAL=1`** comes from the plant model (integrator): it is the
  exact open-loop command for zero trail on constant-velocity targets, not a tuning knob; when the target
  model breaks the FF is **withdrawn on measurement evidence** (innovation-gated), not re-aimed — re-aiming
  needs a fast v̂, which raises estimator loop gain and diverges under mismatch (measured).
- **Damping ratio ζ and phase margin PM are dimensionless design choices** (ff_pi ζ=1 critical damping;
  PM=50° chosen by the mismatch-band test suite).
- The truly free knobs are few, and each is explainable from principle; empirical ones are explicitly
  labeled in each law's docstring.

**Why ff_pi_acc is the shipped law** — the best balance of tracking/lock AND maneuver overshoot in the
library: matched composite 114.7 (step settle 277ms / 3.11px, accel rmse 4.4px, maneuver rmse 19.4px, relock
386ms), FPS behavior suite RMSE 20.4px / event overshoot 28.0px, holding the delay band L20–70 and s0.7–1.3
with no divergence (L80 rides the 3px settle knife edge, as the leaderboard's boundary column states), at
fpsΔ 1.9%. The CUSUM-reset mechanism is principled: a broken target model (stop/reversal) is handled by
discarding the contradicted velocity state and re-running the proven step response, not by patching gains.
The â channel follows the same discipline: innovation-mean acceleration inversion is admitted only on
sustained, plausibility-checked evidence (rebuild suppression + own-acceleration activity gate + significance
floor), and with the channel shut (no sustained real acceleration) the command stream is that of the plain
PI+FF structure, bit for bit.

The firmware implements this law: the capture thread's filter update (`core/estimator.cpp`) carries the â
sensor (cleaned innovation → robust scale → own-acceleration gate → gated ȳ EMA → inversion) and the control
tick (`core/control.cpp`) assembles ê with (v̂+ε) and ½â·W² — mirroring `arena/laws/ff_pi_acc.py` line for
line. Any future challenger must beat ff_pi_acc under the same triple gate before replacing it.

**Laws not shipped** (kept in `arena/`): `ballistic_ff` has the fastest convergence segment (step settle
167ms, relock 219ms, accel 3.9px) but pays worst-mismatch 135.0 and slightly higher event overshoot under
flaky detection, and keeps the L80 settle-fail. `sliding_obs` is the robustness record (full L20–80 + s0.7–1.3
band, flattest profile, OVERALL 138.1) but its P-only tail makes first-reach slow, and hard y-axis stops can
trip the CUSUM reset. `mpc_osc` holds the best worst-mismatch (113.4) and fixes L20, but solves a QP per tick
— unverified against the board's embedded compute — and keeps the L80 knife-edge. `pi_guard` is pi_pm's no-FF
structure plus model-break reset (full band pass); without FF the accel lag a/(Ki·ig) is structural.
`kalman_pi`/`smith_filt` are covered on the Pareto front: the Kalman estimator's model overtrust makes a
FF+CUSUM pack unfixable under mismatch (measured across 50+ configurations), and smith_filt's
settle/relock/recovery records (151ms/198ms/9ms) are bound to an unfiltered extrapolation whose L80/s0.7
corners are structural. `pi_pm`/`sliding`/`ballistic` remain as undominated baselines (their successors carry
disclosed regressions). `imm_pi` is the best matched/FPS law of the whole set (accel 4.3px / maneuver 13.6px,
FPS RMSE 17.1px / event recovery 7ms) but fails the mismatch band outright. `reseed_pi` keeps the shipped
law's nominal behavior with an evidence-gated seed (exact counts-window junk bound) and ties the zero-reset
design at the mismatch edge (125.6 vs 125.1) while keeping the tail gains. If a different trade-off is ever
needed, port the corresponding law's `step()` into `src/core/control.cpp` and `src/core/estimator.cpp`
(units/quantization/counts/estimator must match line for line).

**Rejected paths (documented so they aren't re-explored)**: re-aiming the FF through a fast second velocity
channel raises estimator loop gain and diverges at L30–70; hot design points (PM45–55 × β0≥0.06) pass
matched but their estimator contamination makes step hunting at the band edges — the mismatch band is the
hard constraint of the linear Smith+PI+FF family, and PM50/β0.03 is its test-suite-selected fastest point.
Always-on maneuver-adaptive estimation (IMM, `imm_pi`) dies the same death from inside the estimator: under
mismatch the Smith window misalignment turns own-command transients into large innovations, large innovations
always favor the wide-covariance maneuver model, and the resulting ghost v̂ closes its loop through the
physical plant — every σ̂-normalized gate (NIS authority gate, CUSUM) goes blind exactly when the loop
self-oscillates, because the filter's covariance and the σ̂ EMA absorb the oscillation as "noise" (the σ̂ EMA
runs away and the NIS gate collapses to unity). Online residual-delay adaptation is unobservable in this
bookkeeping: the Smith error is first-order exact under constant velocities (the anchor offset cancels
between the α-β velocity bias and the ê assembly), so the innovation carries no steady-state signature of
Δ = L_true − L̂ — only transient bursts proportional to own-accel × Δ, which are exactly the frames where any
estimate is contaminated. Event-overshoot peaks are bounded below by v·L (delay floor) plus the ~2–3 frame
CUSUM alarm latency (set by the anti-false-alarm per-frame cap), so no estimator-side fix can cut them; only
the post-peak tail is attackable, and paying mismatch margin for it loses on the composite. Evidence-gated
adaptation is the counter-principle that works: keep the adaptive channel closed (or frozen) whenever
own-motion contamination is possible and let it in only on sustained, plausibility-checked evidence — the
validated instances are ff_pi_acc's triple-gated â channel, mpc_osc's innovation-alternation signature gate,
and reseed_pi's window-junk-bound seed gate. Three further walls belong to the same list, each measured
rather than assumed: **the FF+CUSUM pack does not transfer onto a Kalman estimator** — its model overtrust
(position gain ~0.04/frame vs α-β's 0.5) integrates the signed mismatch junk ∝ own-accel × Δ into v̂ where no
gate can separate it from true target motion, and the L20 corner (phantom error v̂·35ms) forbids exactly the
estimator bandwidth the accel tail needs (50+ test-suite configurations, all reject); **the filtered-Smith
family's L80/s0.7 corners are structural** — the pseudo-residual (window mismatch × own velocity) and real
target disturbances are inseparable inside the residual channel, exact cleaning would need L_true which is
not in the law's input, and every online gating criterion either leaves one contamination window open or
fires on legitimate re-capture transients (const_vel/accel break first); and **imm_pi's premise does not
hold** — its steady-state Riccati gain k2 is a per-sample velocity gain used as the per-frame α-β β, so its
"low model" runs at β≈0.25 (8.3× the documented 0.03), and that one too-fast channel produces both its
matched wins and its mismatch collapse; a steady-gain MMAE rebuilt on the corrected semantics tracks markedly
better on matched and accel with L30–70 finite, yet still fails s0.7/L80 and pays a large maneuver and
framerate penalty, so it stays out of the library.

### Known limitations and unverified behaviour

- **未验证: the USB output side has not been exercised against a real host from this board.** All three
  backends' device bytes, report encoders, endpoint bookkeeping and the P5G auth/signing state machine are
  pinned by `build/pad_test`'s structural assertions; what has *not* been observed here is a real PC reading
  the emulated 360 pad through XInput, or a real PS5 accepting the presented P5 General device. The
  dongle-side facts (descriptor identity, feature replies, the signing round trip) are recorded in
  `docs/p5general/` §14, where the host-acceptance half is explicitly left open.
- **未验证: the source-mode-change path of the capture rebuild.** A resolution or refresh change across a
  rebuild (mode switch on the source) is code-read only: the rebuild reads `G_FMT` **after** the lock and
  allocates the buffers from that format, and both the ordering and the buffer-size rule are derived from
  the driver's behaviour rather than observed across an actual mode change — the board's signal source is a
  fixed-mode source, so the walk-through exercised end to end is lock loss → re-lock at an unchanged mode.
- **未验证: a successful round's composed write-back line has not been seen on this board.** The board's
  signal source is a static screen, so every round here ends in the honest "no motion" failure (σ = 0.000
  exactly, script byte-identical) — the *inference leg* is measured and printed by the `[AI FPS]` line, and
  the engine's contract (the written value is the caller's composed total, not the engine's physical `l_est`)
  is pinned by `build/calib_test`, but the three-number round line itself (physical + average + total) has
  only been reviewed, not observed, because a round against a static screen can never succeed.
- **未验证: the codeword-length loss of self-converted models.** The measured resolution loss (one quantised
  tensor carrying both coordinates and confidences) is reported by `model_probe` but not corrected in this
  repository; the fix belongs to the conversion pipeline, outside it.
- arena's default 0.5px noise is optimistic; on a noisier real device ff_pi_acc converges slower — lower
  `PRED_BETA0` first (see Tuning); in extreme cases fall back to a more conservative design point (raise
  `FF_PM_DEG`), or port the sliding_obs law from arena (most robust, slowest).
- The constant-velocity (CV) predictor cannot predict acceleration: constant-accel targets have an a/Ki
  steady-state lag, removed slowly by the I term (maneuver RMSE ~20px is mostly the delay lower bound, not a
  law flaw).
- The speed cap binds before the law does at short range, and it is the first constraint on every
  fast-transient scenario: `arena.diag` puts only 3% of `fps_approach`'s error — the suite's largest, 45.85 px
  with a 184 px peak — on the velocity estimate, and `fps_dash` (4×0.4 = 1.6 px/ms) and the parts of
  `fps_jump_3m` where |v_z| > 1.5 px/ms are saturated the same way. Check `est_share` before attributing such
  errors to the control law. The cap is a physical requirement rather than a preference: the crosshair must
  be able to move at least as fast as the target's screen motion (960·v_world/d px/s, f≈960px at the 1080p
  reference), or the error grows without bound. Below that speed the error is a cliff and above it nothing
  changes — `arena.diag ff_pi_acc fps_approach --max-v 1.7` already moves it 45.85 → 18.88 px — so the useful
  setting is the smallest one clearing the fastest screen motion the system must face, and 2000 px/s clears
  the whole behaviour library at the 1080p reference (10 m dash 1.6, near jump 1.83, approach 1.99 px/ms).
  **It must be rescaled with the source resolution** (see "Tuning"): the deployment signal is 2560×1440, i.e.
  4/3 of that reference, so the same physical working point is 2667 px/s — the value the launcher template,
  the panel's defaults and the CLI now ship. Raising the cap also loosens the
  integrator clamp and the â channel's limits, which moves the 60/120 fps composite split (60 fps improves in
  absolute terms; the ratio widens) and the worst-mismatch composite by about a percent — measure with the
  suites' `max_v` parameter, and see `-x` together with its derivation in the launcher template.
- mpc_osc solves a QP per tick; the board's compute is unverified (feasible in arena at the 2ms tick);
  shipping it would need explicit MPC or a lower solve rate.
- Every law degrades under extreme mismatch (|L_true−L̂|>~30ms or s error >~40%) — beyond what calibration
  should ever produce; ff_pi_acc holds L20–70 + s0.7–1.3 fully, and at the L80 (+30ms) corner its step settle
  rides the 3px knife edge (final ≈3–4px, no divergence). Rely on calibration, not on the law toughing it
  out.
- `src/core/estimator.cpp` advances the filter's `dt` once per frame regardless of whether a detection was
  produced (`t_prev` is updated outside the `found` branch), so across a detection gap the prediction
  advances by a single frame interval and `beta` stays at `PRED_BETA0` — where arena uses the interval since
  the previous *detection*, which is what invariant 1 means. A re-acquisition frame therefore carries the
  whole gap's displacement in its innovation, making the `TRACK_JUMP_GATE` hard reset (and its ~417 ms
  weak-tracking window) more likely. Emulating that deviation (clamping the filter's `dt` to the frame
  interval) is nevertheless measurably neutral rather than harmful under the flaky FPS variant — airborne
  RMSE equal to slightly better than the shipped behaviour, with the same on-body fraction — because holding
  `alpha` at its frame-rate value makes the re-acquisition update more conservative, not less. Correcting it
  is therefore not a route to the airborne trailing, and carries board risk for no measured gain. Changing
  the control section needs a board rebuild.

### How to rerun & extend

1. `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m arena.selftest` to confirm arena alignment.
2. After changing/adding a law: `arena.eval <law>` for the standard test suite; `arena.integrate <law>` for
   the integration (mismatch/relock/framerate included).
3. To see *which layer* a scenario's error lives in before changing anything: `arena.diag <law>
   [scenario ...]` — `est_share` says whether the error is worth attacking with a better estimator (high) or
   is the delay/loop/saturation bound (low); `arena.trace <law> <scenario> --csv out.csv` gives the per-tick
   process.
4. Once a better law is found, port its `step()` logic line for line into the firmware control section
   (`src/core/control.cpp` + `src/core/estimator.cpp`), then `bash scripts/compile.sh` on the board and run
   `bin/aimbot` there. Units/quantization/counts/estimator must match the winning law exactly.
5. Tuning stands on arena measurements, and **delay mismatch must be tested** (the wide-delay sweep in
   `integrate.py`); a scheme that diverges under mismatch loses, no matter how fast.
